<p class="right padding-right2"><i>Lisfarne</i>.</p>
<p>My dear General,</p>

<p>It gave me sincere pleasure to see your hand-writing
once more; and if I had required any
thing beyond the gratification of an assurance
that you had not forgotten your old friend,
to put me in good humour, the commission
which you have given me would secure all the
benevolence of which I am possessed in excusing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
your long silence. Most readily do I accept
the trust which you confide in me, and happy
shall I be if my exertions facilitate the event of
your return to your native land, there to enjoy
the <i>otium cum dignitate</i> to which every man
naturally aspires who has passed the best of his
days in toiling for and realizing an honorable
independence.</p>

<p>It is one of the sophisms of this paradoxical
age in which we live, to prove that the absentee
commits no crime against either patriotism, or
political economy; but I rejoice that you have
not fallen into the snare, and are coming to repose
your mind, and spend your money, where
every honest man ought to bring himself to
anchor; namely, in his own country, and
amongst his own people. By a lucky coincidence
there is a splendid mansion with highly
finished grounds and plantations, just offered
for sale in Hampshire; and if I am fortunate
enough to conclude a bargain for the sum
which I have offered in your name, I shall think
myself no ordinary diplomatist. The present
possessor, Sir Reginald Barnes, is like yourself, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
a <i>nabob</i>, but after rendering his demesne at
Marsden a fit residence for a prince, he is grown
weary of it, and is so anxious to dispose of the
whole as it stands, that I am not without hope
of procuring all you want at a single stroke.</p>

<p>This letter shall be sent through Ingoldsby, to
catch you at the Cape, and of my farther negociation
with Mr. Snubb, Sir Reginald's agent,
you shall have due notice. I know the place for
which I am in treaty, and therefore, if I succeed,
my <i>trouble</i> will be as <i>zero</i>. If not, I must
look elsewhere, and you shall have reports of
progress.</p>

<p>With respect to your relations, I have the
pleasure to give you satisfactory intelligence.
Your eldest brother, poor man, was rapidly
advancing towards "that bourne from which no
traveller returns," when Mr. Howard died and
left him a fine estate, though very heavily burthened,
in Buckinghamshire, together with his
house in Grosvenor-square, plate, books, etcætera.
To substitute the name of Howard
for that of Douglas was all the qualification
required to enable the family to take possession, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and this was soon arranged. Your brother
was taken to his grave without ever having
visited any part of his new property, of which
young Arthur is the heir, and a very fine
youth he is: he will soon be of age, and is
now on a visit in this neighbourhood to his
aunt, Mrs. Henry Douglas, who lives at a
sweet spot which you may remember that I
purchased for my invaluable friend. A legacy
of £20,000 left to your sister-in-law, by her
great aunt, old Mrs. Norton, has enabled that
first of women and mothers to reside at Glenalta,
where she lives adored by her children,
and by all who surround her dwelling. I have
the happiness to enjoy the beloved society
which her family affords, from which I am not
more than half a mile distant, and here I shall
hope to see you, ere long, added to the circle.
Of Mrs. Howard and her daughters I only
know by report: they live <i>in</i> the world, and I
<i>out</i> of it; but of Caroline and her children I
can venture to affirm, that had independence
(beyond which their wishes never appear to
extend) been withheld by Providence, you <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
would never have known them in the character
of needy suppliants, or cringing sycophants.
They are as much above any people with
whom I am acquainted in every noble principle
of heart, as they excel all others that I have met
with in their powers of pleasing. Your nephew
is likely to make a distinguished figure at the
University, and is as amiable as he is clever.</p>

<p>There are three girls, all pretty and accomplished;
and as to your sister, she is such a
woman as, when you have once been in her
company, will no longer permit you to remain
in astonishment that our dear lamented
Henry should have preferred poverty itself in
Caroline's society, to the wealth of Potosi
without her.</p>

<p>I trust to your own taste and discrimination
for this tribute to your departed brother
when you become acquainted with the object
of his tenderest and unceasing affection; and
will not take up any more time in describing the
characters of your family, nor anticipate the
delight which you will feel in exercising your
own judgment as they develope themselves to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
your penetrating eye.</p>

<p>The family of Glenalta beg to send you,
through me, their affectionate greetings, and
old Bentley, who is likewise a neighbour of
mine, and as <i>caustic</i> as ever, desires me to
say how much he rejoices in the hope of
shaking you by the hand.</p>

<p>Farewell, my dear General! may you have
a prosperous voyage, and be permitted, ere
long, to set your foot on British ground once
more! Believe me very</p>

<h2>LETTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Eliza Sandford to Mrs. Douglas.</span></p>

<p>
My beloved Friend,
</p>

<p>Your kind affection has anticipated all that
I have to say: it has pleaded for me more powerfully
than I could do for myslf, and has surely
told you how much I have been engaged on returning
after so long an absence, to Checkley.
At last I begin to breathe; and my little Agnes
makes such rapid advance to returning health,
that I can now, without self-reproach, indulge
in the dearest pleasure of life except that of
conversing with you, and begin once more to
pour out my heart into your faithful bosom.
I may now in full security of our punctual English
posts give you undisguised details of every
thing most interesting, and expect the same from
you, till the happy season arrive which will, I
trust, re-unite us, and give me the delight of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
re-visiting Glenalta. I must obey you before I
follow the dictates of my own feelings, and answer
your questions ere I touch upon matter of
another description. "Describe your girls,"
you say. Well, then, in a few words, they are
dear children: Julia is a charming creature,
and if I do not take the <i>mother too much upon
me</i> in saying so, is worthy of that friendship
which is the boast and pride of her life, and
which is bestowed upon her by your Emily.
<i>Such</i> a letter as she has lately received, describing
<i>the retreat</i>! but I must not digress.
Julia, then, is really, at seventeen, a most interesting
character. She is docile as possible,
singularly artless and innocent, yet possessed of
admirable faculties, which appear capable of
application to a great variety of different pursuits.
In short, whatever Julia attempts she
accomplishes, and performs well, but without
the slightest vanity that I have been able to detect.
Bertha is handsomer, <i>quicker</i>, and more
striking, though not nearly so solid nor reflecting
as her elder sister. She commits more
faults in a week than Julia in a year, from an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
impetuosity of temper which was not corrected
while she was a little one; but her contrition is
so genuine, and her nature so frank, that I
always find myself loving her better than I did
before whenever she has offended. She will
be fifteen, you know, her next birth-day, and
is certainly much improved since we went
abroad.</p>

<p>The extreme youth of my dear girls, my
particular <i>object</i> in leaving England being <i>truly</i>
the recovery of health for one of them; the
recent losses which they had sustained, and my
dislike of company, all conspired to preserve
<i>us</i> from the contagion of foreign influence;
while I was enabled, by taking my young charge
entirely from home, to break at once through a
thousand ties which would have perplexed me
exceedingly had I remained at Checkley. What
I should have found much difficulty in <i>gradually</i>
unloosening, I have now boldly dissevered,
I shall not hold myself under any
obligation to resume the thread of acquaintance
with any whose society may not be advantageous
to my young people, who at present furnish me <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
with ample excuse for declining <i>all</i> invitations,
and thus avoiding <i>jealousy</i> on the part of our
neighbours. Julia has never been in company,
and is the only one of my girls whose age makes
it <i>expected</i> that she should go out. Bertha will
suffer no <i>persecution</i> as yet, and my little dear
Agnes is <i>hors de combat</i>. Her delicate state affords
me a reason, as genuinely sincere as it is
opportune, for lying by in perfect tranquillity;
and during this happy <i>interregnum</i> I shall profit
by your advice, and learn to act with decision
when I am forced out of my retirement.</p>

<p>As I consider myself only in the light of
<i>guardian</i>, and have really no <i>stake</i> in this country
myself, even the most calculating of the
neighbouring gentry must perceive that I am
not bound to any particular style of life; and
the more discriminating amongst them, I may
hope, will give me credit for acting upon principle.
This is all that I want. I know how
impossible it is to <i>please</i> every body, and indeed
I wonder how an upright mind should desire
the approval of a multitude made up of the
most discordant elements; but I am much puzzled, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
notwithstanding, what course to steer, and
shall require all your pilotage to keep me steadily
in the right track. To give you an idea of
my dilemma, I must tell you what sort of people
we are living amongst, and present you with a
survey of our vicinage, before you can be of use
in directing my steps.</p>

<p>The Burleys, who are our nearest neighbours,
are people of large fortune, and decidedly
children of this world. They have sons and
daughters all brought up in luxury. They have
a house in London, go to town every year, have
large expectancies, and <i>so</i> no doubt are full of
the present "life's futurities;" but while they
are in the country, they are inclined to be very
friendly, and it will not be <i>their</i> fault if the inhabitants
of their splendid hall and those of
humbler Checkley are not allied in close intimacy.
I am quite aware how the homely adage
of "for want of company, welcome trumpery,"
applies upon many occasions when fine people
leave the "flaunting crowd," and come to rusticate
for a season in their country seats. But
the Burleys, to do them justice, seem to wish <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
for a familiar acquaintance on truer principles.
Sir Thomas is a complete Englishmen, worthy,
hospitable, open-hearted, up to the eyes in
county politics, and when the affairs of this
<i>wider</i> range are so balanced as not to call forth
the extent of his powers, the parish cabals supply
an under plot, which is sure to keep them
in full practice for larger matters when they may
arrive. At present, the game laws absorb all
that is not given to conviviality, in the circuit
of his head and heart, <i>without</i> the pale of his
own family, <i>in</i> which he is deservedly beloved,
and <i>of</i> which he is the sun-beam. Lady B. is
simply vapid. She is neither ill-natured nor
unkind, but so exceedingly insipid, that were
not a log as troublesome as a wasp, though not
so active, you might be justified in forgetting
that she makes one of the family group. Devoured
by <i>ennui</i> herself, she operates on all
around her till the whole mass would be <i>vaporized</i>,
were it not for the broad good-humour of
her spouse, who is as alert as she is inanimate.
They do not <i>quarrel</i>, however, and the young
people, though very uninteresting, are sufficiently <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
alive to keep up something like cheerfulness,
though not of that species which the
French appropriately denominate <i>gaieté du coeur</i>.
The <i>talk</i> at Burley Hall is so entirely of fashion,
and <i>supposes</i> such a sympathy of pursuit, as well
as conversancy with topics of which Julia is ignorant,
that I question the honesty of permitting
her to associate amongst those whose
thoughts and feelings are so much at variance
with her own, and of such a nature that I never
desire to see her approximate to increased congeniality
with them.</p>

<p>A mile farther off, we have the Henleys;
excellent people, who are from morning till
night engaged in doing good. They are rich
and bountiful, friendly and good-humoured,
but so strict, and so devoted to the <i>letter</i> of their
particular sect, that if you agreed to travel with
them over a line which had been divided into a
hundred distinct measures, of a cubit length in
each, and that after performing ninety-nine
steps in the series, you were to stop at the hundredth,
your former task would go for nothing,
and you would be as completely distanced as if <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
you had never attempted to walk the course.
These good people are anxious in the greatest
degree to enlist my young folks, and like the
nuns think it no harm to employ every art of
affectionate inveiglement to persuade them into
an adoption of a certain distinctive phraseology,
and <i>form</i> of thinking which I do not like, and
therefore shall endeavour to avoid without wishing
to repel the kind fellowship which is proffered,
though I conclude that <i>our</i> religion will
be at once condemned, when it is discovered
that I do not disapprove of many things which
are proscribed at the Priory. I heard it rumoured
the other day, that I am considered one
of the <i>pie-bald</i> race. What am I to do?</p>

<p>Well, a third description of neighbour, and
by much the most numerous, I find planted in
three or four pretty places at no great distance
from Checkley. There is a family of Liner,
another of Peachum, and others whose names I
need not plague you by calling over, who with
competent fortunes enjoy all the comfort of life
which money can bestow, and feel all the title to
consideration which belongs to independence; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
<i>but</i> who are so intolerably dull, unimproving, and
self-complacent, so vulgar too in a perpetual rivalry
of fine dinners, fine furniture, and fine
dress, which have not even the stamp of fashion
to recommend them, that my mind revolts
against introducing my nieces into such a society
as they form.</p>

<p>A fourth order remains to be mentioned,
and here my pen could expatiate, untired of so
delightful a theme. There is a family of Stanley
who live six miles from this, and with whom it
would be delightful to live in constant communion,
if the distance between our two houses did
not throw a barrier in the way of daily intercourse.
They put me in mind of the Douglas
circle, and can I say more to mark the estimation
in which I hold them? Father, mother,
and children of both sexes are superior to almost
any people that I have ever met with,
learned, informed, accomplished, the mind is
kept in a continual round of exertion in their
company, refreshing from its variety, and stimulating
from its animation. An hour passed at
Brandon Court supplies materials for a week's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
<i>rumination</i>; and, like animals that chew the
cud, we repose day after day, living on the nutriment
which we have collected in the fertile
pastures of that attractive spot. Nature's economy
is such, in the midst of her lavish profusion,
that she seldom endows the same individual
with very opposite qualities; and we usually
seek for the serenity of contemplation in scenes
and amongst people far remote from the busy
practitioner. The Stanleys, like yourselves,
combine all the characteristics so rarely found
in union. At Brandon Court you have meditation,
not monastic&mdash;seriousness, not rigid&mdash;sentiment,
never morbid&mdash;and practical energy,
neither coarse nor bustling. Perfect harmony
subsists amongst the various members of the interesting
group. Mr. and Mrs. Stanley are
truly <i>one</i>. Every thought expressed by either,
meets from the other a response of delighted affection,
whilst a joyous band of happy youth
disport around them, whose only rivalry consists
in trying who shall contribute most to the general
stock of happiness, and pay most attention <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
to the cherished authors of their being.</p>

<p>I fancy that I hear you exclaim, "How can
Elizabeth hesitate? Why not cultivate the
Stanleys, and forget that there is a vulgar world
to be passed by?" I will tell you why Elizabeth
doubts what path to choose. These inestimable
persons are stigmatized by the paltry and
mindless animals who environ them, and the
Miss Stanleys are yclept blues, while all the rest
are called philosophers.</p>

<p>For <i>myself</i> you know, that I have no possible
feeling upon such a subject. Were I called
<i>Blue</i>, because I was seen with the Stanleys,
or reading any thing but a novel, it would not
signify. <i>My</i> walk in life has long been determined,
and I have outlived (if indeed I ever
felt like the Mimosa upon such occasions) all
sensibility to those nick-names, which are so
generously bestowed upon single women. I am
a <i>veteran</i>, and can stand fire. I can endure to
be called by any appellation, the <i>true</i> meaning
of which, is that I have preferred remaining
unmarried to being encumbered by the cares of
wedded life; and if heaven have granted any <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
measure of understanding, have chosen to employ,
rather than let it lie fallow. But this is
my individual view of the matter. Have I a
right to place my <i>nieces</i> in society which they
would certainly love and imitate? am I to incur
for them the obloquy that waits on superior
knowledge and acquirements in their sex? impeding
perhaps, also, the chances of that settlement
in future life which, though I have never
desired for myself, and am in reality very indifferent
about for them, I am still bound to
consider as the ordinance of nature, besides
being the point to which the artificial laws of
the world are universally directed. Many cares
will necessarily spring up in my way as I proceed,
but at present, how to steer a middle
course between Scylla and Charybdis is my
chief difficulty. With the inanity of fashion,
and its opposite vulgarity on the one hand; a
religion which deals too much in external observances,
and the reproach of female <i>learning</i>
on the other, is there any <i>honest</i> method by
which, without sacrificing integrity of principle,
I may <i>skim the cream</i> of <i>each</i> class, and save <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
my children from the evils attendant upon <i>all</i>
the classes that I have described? Be my
Cumean Sybil; look into the page of destiny
for me; say what is before me, and how I shall
act.</p>

<p>The priest in the proverb, "christens his
own child first;" you see that I have adopted
the same prudent maxim, and given you nothing
as yet, but my own story; but for this you need
no apology my dearest Caroline. Innumerable
interruptions break my purposes, and deprive
me of any command over my time just now.
By and by I shall be able to write less selfishly
I trust, and repay your kindness by more agreeable
matter than you will find in a <i>dish</i> of egotism
which I have served up for your this day's
fare. Before I release you, however, I must
tell you that I was not a little surprised yesterday,
by the appearance of an Irish acquaintance,
Mr. Bentley, whom I have seen frequently
at Lisfarne, and uncle to George, who is, I believe,
an intimate still at your house, and Mr.
Otway's. When I was at Glenalta, the young
man was, I suppose, at the University, for I did <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
not see him, but I heard the girls and Frederick
name him familiarly.</p>

<p>In the midst of giving directions to my work-men,
a travelling carriage drove up to the hall-door,
and I was really delighted to see Mr.
Bentley, who is a highly respectable man, but
who appeared in a new light of interest to my
eyes, from all the associations which his presence
awakened. I endeavoured to shew how glad I
felt to see him; and though I could not prevail
with him to make a longer stay, he indulged me
by remaining, to pass a few hours, and walk
round our pretty grounds. In the course of
conversation, I asked for his nephew, and was
answered, that he was at Lisfarne, where he
would remain till Mr. Bentley, senior, returns to
the county of Kerry. I spoke of the advantage
which any young person must derive from such
society as that of Mr. Otway, upon whose character
I expatiated with my usual warmth.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mr. Bentley, "Otway is a
noble fellow, though one of your <i>oddities</i>; and
poor George absolutely worships him, but nevertheless;
I am not very sure that his staying <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
at Lisfarne is for either his happiness or advantage."</p>

<p>"Pray, how so?" answered I, "with perfect
unconsciousness."</p>

<p>"My dear madam," said the good man,
"your friends at Glenalta are too near I should
think, for my poor boy's peace. I do not say
that <i>it is</i> so. I only mean that such things
flow naturally from near neighbourhood, which
often brings people into <i>scrapes</i>. I have known
many a heart lost through the insensible influence
of contiguity. <i>Op</i>portunity is the deadliest
foe of the one sex, <i>Im</i>portunity of the
other; and between them both, many a match
is brought about, to which an unwilling consent
is wrung out of parents and guardians when it
is too late to withhold one's fiat."</p>

<p>I looked grave, and begged him to be explicit.
"Do you speak merely," said I, "Mr.
Bentley, upon a general supposition of what
may be possible, or have you any reason to suppose
that your nephew's happiness is likely to
be endangered? Not the remotest suspicion has
ever glanced across <i>my</i> mind, and I should take <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
it as a favour, if, since you have touched upon
the subject, you would enlighten me farther, by
mentioning the ground of your surmise?"</p>

<p>"My dear ma'am, it is not <i>actually</i> surmise.
I may be wrong, and must acquit George of
having given me the slightest insight into his
mind. In fact, he is very close; it is the only
fault that I find with him, and my sole reason
for <i>suspecting</i>, is derived from my own observation
of his avidity to puzzle his brains about a
great many useless things, such as chemistry,
botany, and the like, which never put a guinea
into a young gentleman's pocket. Now, you
know that Mrs. Douglas and her daughters are
so learned, that they could sack a grand jury;
though I must do them the justice to add, that
no people in the country are more beloved than
they are. Nothing can exceed their unpretending
goodness. But George has no pretensions;
he must make his own way in the world, and
cannot afford to waste his precious hours in
learning what I call <i>fal lals</i>, that will never
help him through life. To tell you the honest
truth, I am a little jealous of both Lisfarne and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Glenalta. I see no business that any young
man has to love or like mortal better than his
own flesh and blood; and more time and wits
are lavished in these foolish <i>episodes</i> which just
end in nothing, than would put a man many a
mile forward in his professional career. People
fall in love through very idleness and vacuity.
A young tenant of my own, excused himself
lately, when I asked him what could possess him
to marry a girl without sixpence, by replying,
'Indeed, sir, she lived <i>so handy</i> that we were
always together, and 'twas the same thing we
thought to get married.' Poor George would
be probably dismissed by the Douglas family if
they entertained the least idea of such presumption,
as no doubt, a hope on my nephew's part,
would be considered; and you will therefore not
wonder, my dear Mrs. Sandford, that I am
anxious to get my business in London, and a
month at Buxton well over, that I may return
home, where it is necessary that George should
see after my affairs during my absence. I have
seen a great deal of life, though not upon a
<i>grand</i> scale; and I know the folly of romance. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Mrs. Douglas, I make no question, is as prudent
as she is sensible, and has never given her
children so elegant an education, to throw them
away upon paupers. My own opinion is, that
money is the only thing that does not disappoint.
I do not say the only thing that is <i>good</i>, far
from it; but while mental qualities may be only
feigned, sweet tempers and dispositions assumed
but for a season, accomplishments suffered
to languish, beauty doomed to fade, money
performs its promise, and procures all the comfort,
and all the happiness that it ever engages
to purchase. I repeat this every week of my
life to poor George, but he is so reserved, that I
never have the satisfaction of hearing whether
or not I make any impression upon him."</p>

<p>To this <i>exposé</i>, I listened with the most profound
attention, and could only reply, "my
dear sir, it appears to me that you are putting
trouble out to interest, and <i>compound</i> interest,
by the view that you take of your family affairs.
I can assure you that the remotest hint has
never reached me, respecting any suspicion of a
feeling such as you ascribe to your nephew, who <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
I dare say, is too much in the habit of venerating
your counsels to fly in your face, by presuming
to bestow his affections without your
approbation; though whenever he <i>does</i>, at some
distant period of his life, obtain your permission
to offer his hand in marriage, I conclude that
you will have no objection to his loving his wife
better than you, as he must make a solemn vow
to that effect, and cleave to her in preference to
all created things. But of one part of your
anxiety, I can with certainty relieve you; rest
assured, that if the slightest symptom appeared
to warrant my friend, Mrs. Douglas, in <i>imagining</i>
as you do, the most decisive measures would
be instantly adopted to prevent any painful
result."</p>

<p>"I <i>thought</i> so; I always <i>said</i> so," rejoined
hastily, Mr. Bentley. "I knew that Mrs.
Douglas had a judgment too profound not to
determine on marrying her daughters to men of
fortune. I have told my opinion in George's
presence (not <i>to</i> him, for the last thing I should
desire, would be to convey to <i>his</i> mind, that an
idea, such as I have confided to you, ever entered <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
<i>mine</i>), a thousand and a thousand times; and I
feel that my discernment is extremely flattered
by your assurance, that I saw how the land lay
so clearly. Your allusion to interest, and compound
interest, is very just and beautiful; and I
declare that you have set my mind quite at rest."</p>

<p>So enraptured was the poor man, or rather I
<i>suspect, rich</i> man, with his own sagacity, and
my illustration, that I found the greatest possible
difficulty in edging in a word or two to undeceive
him respecting your mercenary projects.
If none are so blind as those who will not see,
there are certainly none more deaf than such as
will not hear. Full of courtesy, bustle, and
acknowledgment, this little worldly, but goodly
<i>puffin</i>, bundled himself up in his chaise, and
posted off, lightened of a load of care, and in
such buoyant humour, that I prophecy a fortnight
at Buxton will do the needful, and return
him in half the time that he had devoted to his
bodily weal, in a state of perfect restoration, to
Mount Prospect and "poor George."</p>

<p>When he was gone, I resolved on giving you
intimation of all that had passed. It is very <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
evident to me, that this visit, which I took so
kindly, was paid at Checkley, for the sole purpose
of <i>sounding</i>; and I think that I can perceive
exactly the conflict of his mind. His
vanity would be flattered to the highest degree,
by even the remotest hope that his nephew
might be accepted at Glenalta, while he is also
manifestly bent on a rich wife for George with
such hearty purpose, that no disappointment is
consequent upon believing, as he now does, that
there is no chance of a Miss Douglas for his
niece. I am <i>sure</i> that he has a very <i>snug</i> store
laid up somewhere or other; that being an old
batchelor, George is his object, and that had he
found reason for his conjecture in any confirmation
afforded by me, he would have taught himself
to be very well pleased, while he can, as
sincerely, turn the current of his thoughts into
another stream, in which he hopes that a larger
quantity of the precious metals may be found.
How comically people who are accustomed to
employ a little cunning in their devices, betray
themselves. Old Bentley, however, is a worthy
man; and a very acute, though rather a vulgar <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
observer. You need not dread the slightest
indiscretion on his part, in making the young
man a party in his cogitations. One excellent
remark which he made with much shrewdness,
convinced me that you have nothing to fear on
that score. "Madam," said he, "I shall never
give George the remotest hint of what has been
passing in my head. No, no, when you want to
keep young people from committing themselves,
be very sure of what you are about, in expressing
your fears upon the subject. If you have
reason to <i>know</i> that there is an understanding,
why then you <i>must</i> either sanction or refuse,
and of course must speak; but if you have to
deal with timidity, or reserve, be assured that
the first word is half the battle; and in proclaiming
your own apprehensions, you have at one
stroke levelled a barrier which might have remained
for ever impregnable but for your incaution."</p>

<p>Well, dearest friend, here is a long letter.
Let me have a speedy answer, and tell me of
George Bentley; is there any foundation for
his uncle's fancy: is he a person of whom you <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
could ever think, for one of your dear children?
My sweet girls unite in all that is affectionate to
their young friends. Farewell.</p>

<h2>LETTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Arthur Howard to Charles Falkland.</span></p>
<p>
My dear Falkland,
</p>

<p>Whether I blush or not is not for me to
tell; but surely I feel that I ought to do so.
Yes, it is an absolute fact, that I am ashamed to
recollect the date of my last letter; and, therefore,
if you please, we will hush it up. All that
I will put forward in extenuation of my guilt is,
that my journal bears weighty evidence to the
truth of your not being forgotten. In that
faithful repository you will find, one of these
days, a minute registry of all that passes; and I
promise myself much amusement at some future
time in recalling to my own mind, while I read
it to you, this record of the happiest period of
my life. Hey day! here is a downright confession.
Even so: and I am not inclined to
retract the avowal. As I am not in love, (at
least I do not <i>believe</i> that I am,) I suppose that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
I have less hesitation in proclaiming the state of
my feelings than were Dan Cupid to be a witness
to the declaration of my being more at
home at Glenalta, and more happy with the
Douglas family, than I ever felt at any place,
and amongst any people, since I was born. I
find one great disadvantage in having lost the
thread of my good old diary, for I know not
now where to begin or what to tell you, though
I would have you to know that my difficulty
does not arise from paucity of incident. On
the contrary, my time has been so occupied,
and so many novelties have varied the scene,
that I am, to use a homely illustration, in the
predicament of "not being able to see the wood
for trees." The <i>ground tint</i> of life at Glenalta
is soft and reposing, without being dead; and
it has latterly been <i>picked</i> out (my simile
savours, you will say, of Long Acre) by sundry
events which have given contrast to its colouring.
You are to be informed that I am up to
the eyes in all the pursuits which afford constant
delight to the Cousins: and would you <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
believe that from morning till night I am never
conscious of time, except by its rapid flight?
Falkland, I am awakened as if from a heavy
sleep, which had dulled my faculties, and my
mind seems to take new views of everything.
Will this last? If it should, the age of man is
doubled by the animation of such feelings as
have been evolved in this Irish world. I tread
on air&mdash;the sun shines into my <i>heart</i>&mdash;and
you will never hear me again envying an opium-eater
while I live. In three days we set out for
Killarney; and, as I will certainly devote a letter
exclusively to the <i>Lakes</i>, this shall contain a
sketch of some minor exploits in the way of
sight-seeing.</p>

<p>But I ought not to have proceeded thus far
without saying that our Fred. returned, after
his short absence, wreathed with victory; and I
would give more than I am worth to have been
able to call back the shade of Titian by some
magical incantation, that his glowing pencil
might have <i>fixed</i> that arrival in perennial freshness.
Domestic love, what an exquisite painter
thou art! Not all the most skilful efforts of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
factitious refinement can group and touch like
this artist of Nature.</p>

<p>It was Frederick's plan to be his own messenger;
and, therefore, as no announcement of
success or failure preceded his appearance
amongst us, suspense hung upon the carriage-wheels
as it drove to the very door, and only
gave way to joyful assurance, from the uncontrolable
gladness of Domine's eye, which sparkled
a contradiction, detected at the first glance by
Fanny, to the serious air with which the travellers
had determined on playfully deceiving
the sisterhood. "The Science Premium" presently
resounded through the air, and a delighted
group of servants, headed by old Lawrence,
wafted the glad tidings to an outer circle, who
stood peeping from behind the holly-hedge,
ready to catch the first contagion that might
reach them of joy or sorrow, without understanding
how excited, or for what displayed.</p>

<p>When the transport seemed at its height,
Mr. Oliphant abruptly exclaimed, "But how
easily you are all satisfied! Not a soul has
asked me what became of all <i>my</i> hard work at <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Greek and Latin." Here followed the news
that Fred. was doubly crowned, and had also
borne away the palm of classical triumph. This
was too much; the cup of bliss was full before,
and now it overflowed. No, I never saw any
thing like it; and even <i>this</i> scene, I suppose,
could never <i>again</i> produce the magical sensations
which I felt. The intensity of emotion,
and the gradations evinced in its exhibition,
from the silent, grateful tear that trickled down
the hectic cheek of aunt Douglas&mdash;then passing
through the gentle transports of Emily and
Charlotte, the mad delirium of Fanny, the
honest pride of Oliphant, the full, yet chastened
glow of Frederick, the paternal exultation of old
Lawrence, down to the untutored burst of the
barefooted mountaineers, reminded me forcibly
of that admirable picture by Le Thiers of the
Judgment of Brutus, in which you and I used
to admire the author's tact in apportioning the
varieties of expression in all those numerous
countenances, to the exact measure of refinement
in each which accompanied the feeling
that gave it birth. After the first tumult of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
congratulations had subsided, I ran to the seashore,
to get rid of some unwelcome thoughts,
that were not in unison with the scene which I
had witnessed, when I overtook a little band of
young peasants, who were dragging along large
bundles of what we call gorse, but is here yclept
furze; and this circumstance soon turned the
current of my musings.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, my lads?" quoth I.
"Plase your honour, to get ready the bonfires
for Maaster Frederick agin the evening." "I
am a stranger in these parts, and should like to
know what all this work is for," said I, turning
to a fine, active youth, who led the van. "Why,
indeed, sir, I don't <i>rightly</i> know; but, be what
I can larn, Maasther Fred. is to be King o' the
College from this time out." "Och! you fool,
Jack!" cried another, "that isn't it at all. I
heard my father say just now that he was (that's
Maasther Fred.) <i>cheered</i> round the city like a
Parliamint man, and that he flogged all the
scholars in Ireland." "Well <i>you're</i> out too,
Flurry," vociferated a third; "for Nance Hagerty
tould Kit Lacy and she ought to know, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
be raison of being about the cows morning and
evening at the big house, that Maaster Fred.
got a power of money for making an illigant
spaach about mancipashon."</p>

<p>I was greatly amused. It was all the same to
these poor fellows. Joy was depicted on every
face at Glenalta, and to enquire into whys and
wherefores is quite too tame for the rush of Hibernian
sympathy. The meeting with <i>Phil.</i> was
another rich repast of mind; and young Bentley
seemed so share the scene like a brother. When
I returned to dinner, I found preparations going
forward near the house which ended in a
piper and a dance upon the green turf, in which
the young people of the family took part. A
great basket of bread-cakes sweetened with a
little sugar, and a single draught to each of
Kerry cider, made <i>all</i> the entertainment as related
to eating and drinking; hilarity and affection
supplied the rest, and I could not help remarking,
that I had never till then seen so
many people made supremely happy at so
trifling an expense. With us at Selby it would
have required the winning wiles of at least an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
ox, and tree tierces of ale, to have prevailed on
so many people to come together. When assembled,
they would neither pipe nor dance:
the gladdest tribute would consist in a few
deafening shouts, and, after some coarse and
clumsy merriment, the well-fed sons of England
would stagger home, filled to the throat, regardless
of all sentiment which could not be
identified with roast beef and brown stout. Only
give an Irish population permission to share in
your feelings, and you may have a crowd at
your heels in a moment, in any part of the
kingdom, as I am told; but I can now say from
experience, that, if you <i>deserve</i> affection, you
may have an honest flow of its choicest streams
unbought, except by reciprocating kindness.
These poor people would endure anything for
my aunt, her children, and Mr. Otway; and
though I have given you a ridiculous specimen
of ignorance, in relating the conversation of the
bonfire, I am bound in justice, as a <i>set off</i>, to add,
that when the festivities of the evening were at
an end, Mr. Oliphant beckoned to two youths,
who appeared to be about seventeen or eighteen, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and whom he called by the names of Cronin
and Riely, saying, "Boys, I know very well
that you are just longing to hear more about
Mr. Frederick, so come in the morning, bring
your Homer, and I will show you the part in
which he was examined." The poor fellows
seemed overjoyed, and kicking up a bare heel
behind, pulled each a lock of hair on his forehead
in token of thanks, neither of these young
men having a hat with which to perform the
ceremony of a bow, and this extra-ordinary mode
of salutation serving as the substitute here for a
more civilized mode of obeisance. To my
amazement, I now learned that several individuals
are to be found in these mountains who can
read Horace and Virgil familiarly. The Homer
which was brought in the morning was a curiosity
too, for so filthy, so broken, and so disjointed
a concern, I suppose you never beheld;
and it astonished me, not only to hear these tattered
academicians read passages with precision
which were almost effaced, but translate with
fidelity, of which Cowper would not have been
ashamed. Frederick gave them each a new <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
book, and I presented a trifling sum to be expended
in shoes and hats, sending off our poor
scholars as happy as kings are said to be in
fairy tales. When Frederick had been at home
a day or two, he proposed that we should make
the first use of his liberty in extending our excursions
both by land and water. "We will begin
with the nearest object," said he, "and as
you enter with so much zeal into our Irish character,
I <i>must</i> take you to see a person whom we
have given the name of Wise Ned of the Hill."
The next day was appointed, and we were on
horseback at four in the morning, each provided
with a sort of <i>wallet</i>, containing an ample
supply of sandwiches, a small bottle of brandy, a
canister of snuff for Ned, with a large parcel of
newspapers, and a tin box (which Fanny insisted
on adding to our accoutrements) to be filled with
any plants which Glenalta did not produce. In
this rustic guise, accompanied by three fine dogs,
one of which is a noble animal of a species now
very scarce, namely, the Irish wolf dog, we commenced
our campaign, halting at Lisfarne, to
call for young Bentley, by whom we were speedily <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
joined. As we rode along, I begged to
know in the true Irish style what it was that we
were going to see, and why "Ned of the Hill,"
was worthy of a pilgrimage to his shrine. "He
is," said Frederick, "a most uncommon character,
and one who will, I think, reward your
trouble in <i>getting at him</i>, for I can tell you that
his only neighbours are the eagles. Ned, like
the poor boys of Homeric memory, received an
education beyond the vulgar level, in the days
of his youth. He was born of parents who were
strict Roman Catholics; and having an uncle
who was priest in a neighbouring parish, it was
intended that young Edmund Burke (a promising
name, you will say) should succeed to
his relation's holy office. With this view he
was taught Greek and Latin, though his temporal
situation was scarcely raised above absolute
want. His father was an idle profligate, his
mother a bigot, entirely under the control of
her brother, the priest. The boy grew up in
the strange jumble of fastings and confessions,
prayers and penances, with swearing, drinking,
and all manner of profaneness, acted continually <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
in his presence, till his father was suddenly
seized with a fit of apoplexy, on recovering from
which he had some 'compunctious visitings,'
and desired his son, for the first time, to read
the Bible for him. There was none to be had
except one which had been left in pledge by a
poor Protestant woman, who owed a trifle to
the little shop kept by these people. Ned objected
to read out of such an unholy book, but
the father insisted, alleging that his time was
hastening to a close, and it was no season to
stand upon ceremonies. A Bible was a Bible;
and, if it was good <i>at all</i> to read it, the Protestant
version could not be <i>very</i> far astray.
Ned reluctantly complied, and felt it necessary
at first, I dare say, to perform a sort of quarantine
after touching the sacred volume; but his
father desired that neither his wife nor the priest
her brother should hear a word about the matter.
The invalid gradually recovered strength,
which he ascribed to the fit of piety that had
come upon him; and though he did not dream
of changing his religion, and was punctilious in
his observance of its rites, he still felt a sort of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
superstitious respect for the book that had been
instrumental in keeping up a serious impression
of divine things upon his mind; and was not
displeased at seeing his son frequently poring
over its contents after the daily task of reading
to the old man was ended."</p>

<p>"At length Ned, through the single and simple
force of truth, became convinced of the
errors of the Romish Church; and, afraid to tell
his parents, he quitted home, and sought the
aid of an exemplary clergyman in an adjoining
county. From this gentleman he received the
kindest treatment, and the most judicious advice
not to be precipitate in the adoption of a new
creed. This good man gave him books, and
protected his destitute youth from persecution,
to which the poor fellow became subject, as soon
as it was hinted that he was likely to renounce
Popery; but Heaven had endowed Ned with
one of those acute understandings which are
rarely found in any class of men, and the
books which were given him by the excellent
pastor under whose tutelage he had placed himself,
did not satisfy his inquiring mind. Contending <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
between a sense of duty to his family,
his temporal benefit, and the habits of his whole
life, on one side, and his newly awakened, and,
as he considered, providentially directed, search
after truth on the other, he roamed about, suffering
the greatest privations, sculking in the
mountains, and indebted to charity for his scanty
fare, till accident brought Mr. Otway to the spot
where he lay stretched upon the heath apparently
dead, and a ragged Bible clenched in his
hands. He was conveyed to Lisfarne, where he
found the asylum after which his soul panted.
When his strength was recruited, he was supplied
with such books as were calculated to meet
the sagacity of his doubts, and a short time made
him a fixed and conscientious believer in the superiority
of the Protestant faith over that in
which he had been educated. About this time
his father died, leaving him a little profit-rent of
fifteen pounds a year, arising out of a poor tenement
in Tralee. This is Ned's <i>all</i>, and as soon
as he became possessed of independence he resolved
to quit his benefactor and devote himself
to the good of his fellow creatures. No argument <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
will tempt him to accept of a salary that
would better his condition. A few books, newspapers,
and a little snuff, are all that he will permit
any of us to add to his hermit's fare. You
will see his dwelling, and be surprized perhaps
by his remarks. The mountain on which he resides
belongs to an absentee nobleman, and Ned
lives there unmolested amongst almost inaccessible
crags. The singularity of his character, its natural
force, and the genuine disinterestedness of
conduct which he manifests, combine to produce
unbounded influence on the minds of the people,
who, notwithstanding the charge of heresy
against him, seek his advice, and consider his
wisdom as quite oracular. Ned's life is passed
in doing good. He traverses hill and dale on
foot in quest of all whom he can succour by his
counsel or sooth by his kindness. His Bible
travels with him, and in spite of the avowed hatred
of the priests, and the heavy denunciations
of punishment which two or three of them have
fulminated against any one who shall listen to, or
harbour, poor Ned, he is a universal favourite,
and often let in at a back door when his hosts <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
would not venture to receive him at the front of
their miserable hovels. He reads the scriptures
incessantly, expounding and applying them to
the individual necessities of his needy neighbours.
He attends the fairs, and prevents many
a quarrel. His talents as an arbitrator are in
such request that he keeps several paltry cases
of contention from the petty sessions, and is even
consulted as an almanack, for the signs of bad
or good weather."</p>

<p>With this outline of Ned's character and
history we approached his extra-ordinary <i>tabernacle</i>,
which had no appearance whatsoever
of human dwelling, till we reached it close
enough to see a little wreath of blue smoke
curling up from an orifice in the rock, and
were assailed by the sharp and angry bark of
a terrier, who lay sunning himself, with a cat
lying close by him on a tuft of dried heath. A
few great stones piled one upon the other, at
each side of a natural aperture in the craggy
face of the mountain, seemed to indicate the
hand of man in bringing them together, and
likewise to afford shelter to the entrance. A <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
stout wooden door opening inwards appeared
the only means of ingress to admit even the
light of heaven, for windows I saw none.</p>

<p>A few goats were roused from their <i>meditations</i>
by our arrival, and I had just pronounced
the name of Robinson Crusoe to my companions,
when, at the end of our scramble,
which had occupied three hours in its performance,
Ned himself started from his <i>lair</i>,
and stood before us clad in a strong comfortable
loose coat of a greyish frize, manufactured
in this country by the poor people.
He had shoes and stockings of coarse but
warm materials; and moreover, a hat, which,
though it had seen better days, defended his
head from the rude blast of this desolate wilderness,
and was fastened to a button-hole by
an old red worsted garter. Such was his joy
at sight of Frederick, that some minutes elapsed
before he seemed sensible that his friend had
any companions. "Oh, sir," said he, "the
news came to me just as I was lying down
last night; Tom Collins sent off little Maurice
his son to Tim Scannel, who put his brother <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
across the bay in the fishing-boat; and he ran
every step o'the way over the hills till he
brought me <i>the account</i>."</p>

<p>To have asked <i>what</i> account would have
been a direct insult to all Ned's best feelings,
and so Frederick thought, for he replied,
"Well, though I am grateful to poor Collins,
and also to Scannel, I am very sorry that
they have been beforehand with me; I thought
to have had the pleasure of telling you myself."
"Never mind," answered Ned, "they, poor
fellows, have not so many pleasures as you have,
don't <i>begrudge</i> them <i>that</i>, for they had a sore
<i>trot</i> of it bare legged over the stones to bring
me the news; and by the same token I had
nothing but two or three potatoes that were
cold in the dish after my supper to give Jack
after his long tramp over the mountain, and
he was afraid of being late for work in the
morning, so would not wait till I could get
him a drop of milk."</p>

<p>Here was a journey of at least eight miles, by
the shortest route, across the bay, performed at
the end of hard day's work without the refreshment <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
of food or sleep, and without the expectation
of a single sixpence to reward the toil!
La Bruyere, Rochefaucauld, and all the host of
the Machiavelian school to boot, could hardly
<i>concoct</i> a bad motive out of the given materials,
with all the maceration and trituration which
they could put this action through in their
moral crucible, which can contrive to disfigure
so much of human nature. The <i>worst</i> incentive
to such a deed which ingenuity could extract
from its analysis, might perhaps be discovered
in that love of stimulus common to all
lively people, and of which the Irish are peculiarly
susceptible: they love to surprise, and
be surprised; but I feel certain that Tom Collins
would have performed the part of <i>Speaking Trumpet</i>
to "Ned of the Hill," without the
aid of this excitement. I am becoming enthusiastic
about these Hibernians: but to return
to our mountain sage. He received us with
native courtesy: his small deal table was quickly
spread with the sandwiches which we had
brought, to which Ned added a pot of fine
smoking potatoes, and a red-herring or two <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
which he took from a stick on which they
were hanging in the chimney. Brandy and
water (the latter from a stream clear as chrystal
that babbled by his door) finished our repast;
and, whether from the effect of novelty, my
long ride, the purity of the mountain air, or
all united, I cannot tell, but I never remember
to have thought the best dinner in London
half so good as this upon the top of an almost
trackless waste, from which we could see nothing
but a boundless expanse of ocean lying to the
west. When we had finished our luncheon,
or whatever you please to call it, Ned invited
us to come and sit by the stream in which he
said that we should find the finest water-cresses
that ever were seen; and "Gentlemen," said
he, "I will get you an oaten cake, and new
laid eggs, and plenty of milk, before you quit
me."</p>

<p>In the first part of his invitation we acquiesced,
but told him that my aunt would be
uneasy if we were not at home early, and
would wait dinner. "Go, then," said Ned,
"and my blessing go with you; for I would <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
not have her suffer the smallest fretting or
vexation for all the pleasure of your company
during a whole week. She is a good mother,
and a good Christian; and deserves all the
love and duty that you can shew her."</p>

<p>We then walked with poor Ned, and I begged
of Frederick to draw him out in conversation,
that I might hear some of his opinions. When
we were about a quarter of a mile from his <i>fortress</i>,
Ned invited us to sit down in a sunny
nook, formed by the rock, where the stream
widened into a large surface, and here we
found the cresses with which our host had
promised to crown our simple repast. "I
often," said he, "bring a handful of potatoes
here, with a grain of salt, and gather a few of
these to make out my dinner. It is a fine
thing, sir, to think how easily a man may live,
and that too upon food better for him than a
lord mayor's banquet."</p>

<p>"You are very happy, Ned, I should think,"
said Bentley, who looked at him with the most
profound admiration.&mdash;"No one is happy,"
answered the hermit; "but I believe that I <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
am as much so as anybody, for I am contented
with the lot in which Providence has
placed me, and would not desire to exchange
it. Man is a poor creature, his life is but a
vapour, and the less that he is in the way of
temptation the better is it for him in time and
in eternity."</p>

<p>"Ned," said Frederick, "you have leisure
for meditation, and wish that you would tell
me what you think of public affairs at present?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, I should be considered a bad
judge of what the public are about, I who
live in the desert; but as every man has his
own way of thinking, I have mine."</p>

<p>"This is," said I, "a time of great <i>stir</i>, and
a great deal is <i>doing</i> that ought to tell either
one way or the other for much good or evil."</p>

<p>"Ned smiled, and answered, "Sir, <i>you</i>
might set up for an oracle, for you are <i>sure</i>
to be right, as your prophecy will answer
either way: and that is the method that a
great many take to get <i>over</i> a knotty point,
when they do not know how to get <i>through</i>
it. No offence, sir, I hope."</p>

<p> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>I really felt a little disconcerted, and my companions
laughed; but I begged Ned to explain
what he thought himself of king's ministers, men,
and nations.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, indeed we all flatter ourselves,
even such a poor humble being as I
am, that we can see all the working of the
puppets, little and big, but people are often
mistaken who have better means of coming at
the truth than I have: all the way, sir, that I
have to know what is doing in the world is by
the newspapers, which my young master there
(looking at Frederick) kindly brings me, and
my notion is, from spelling and putting together,
that though I may never live to see the
day when such a matter will come to pass, a
revolution is hanging over these countries
as sure as you are sitting there opposite to
me."</p>

<p>"That would be a strange event, Ned,"
said I, "as the consequences of those changes to
which I alluded, I meant the change from
darkness to light, from ignorance to knowledge."</p>

<p>"Sir, I mean the same thing, though I do <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
not give such good names to what I think
undeserving of them."</p>

<p>"Why, Ned," "said Bentley, "I know a
place within three miles of this spot where you
go three or four times a-week to teach: how
does your conduct consist with what you have
said?"&mdash;"It fits like a pea in the pod, sir,"
replied Ned; "I go to give what instruction I
can to a few poor things who are longing to
know God through His word; and as some are
too young, and others too weak to climb this
rugged height, I go to the foot of the mountain
to meet them; and don't you think that I
would teach every man, woman, and child, if
I could make them learn the road to heaven?"
I told him that Nature herself seemed to point
a finger to the course of education in Ireland,
for that such surprising faculties as I found
in the poor sons and daughters of Erin could
never have been designed by their Creator to
lie dormant. "Young man, we know," replied
Ned, "nothing of God's designs, and your
reason for teaching right hand and left, is
about as just as if you were to burn a hay-rick <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
in your neighbour's farm, and when you were
asked why you did such mischief, you were
to answer, that a heap of combustibles was lying
convenient, and that as combustibles were by
nature made to be burned, you thought proper
to set them on fire. But, sir, my notion is,
that the gentry are, as fast as they can, changing
sides with the mob of the country, for they
are winding off at the upper end of the spindle as
much as they are winding on at the bottom,
and so it will be only one thing in the place
of another after all. Education seems to be
declining amongst the <i>heads</i> of the community,
as much as it is flourishing amongst the <i>tails</i>,
and, before long, it will be found that the tails
will take the post where the heads are now."</p>

<p>"Upon what grounds do you prognosticate
this up-side-down, this new order, or disorder,
of things?" said Bentley.&mdash;"Why, sir, upon
two grounds: first, upon the ground of my natural
reason, which tells me that it cannot be
otherwise; and, secondly, upon the ground of
the newspapers, which shew me that the matter
is already coming to pass under our own <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
eyes. Without any help to my own thoughts,
I should be a fool outright if I did not know
that education is bringing out all the faculties
that were rolled up like those daisies there, before
you, in their winter-quarters, till the sun
warmed the mountain, and untied the cords that
bound every button of them tight and hard in
their green cases. Now, sir, God is no respecter
of persons: His providence has given understanding
to the poor as well as to the rich,
which only wants what it is now receiving to
bring it into full bloom, and if the rich, who
are the smaller number, neglect the instruction
which the poor, who are the greater
number, are eagerly devouring, you will find
how it will be by-and-by: the lean kine will
swallow up the fat; and when men find out
that their hungry wits, sharpened by want,
have gained the power belonging to knowledge,
they will use it, and not rest contentedly
upon a wild heath like this, without asking
themselves the question, "Why should not we
take those places that are held by men who
do not know how to fill them, and benefit ourselves <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and the country by shoving out a set of
pampered geese, and coming down upon their
snug nests with all the force, as I may say, of
those eagles yonder?' Sir, when things are
ripe for this question, the end is at hand."</p>

<p>"But, my good Ned, why suppose this neglect
in the higher classes? What should lead
you to conclude that, though the blessings of
light and knowledge are spreading over the
mass of mankind, the upper ranks are not holding
their own, and cultivating as before, the benefits,
which, with increased liberality, they are
now determined to share?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, I know very well that 'as the
twig is bent the tree's inclined,' and if I look to
your great schools, and your colleges, what do I
see but an undisciplined rabble, doing what
they please, and the masters, who ought to control
youthful vice and folly, become like so
many ciphers. At one of your great seminaries
I see murder committed in a boxing-match,
and the whole affair hushed up, as if no harm
were done. At another of your great schools,
the man to whose care the morals of your <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
English youth are intrusted, runs away without
saying a word to any one, leaving a debt of
£50,000 behind him.</p>

<p>"Did I not hear young Master Fitzallan tell
his father the other day that after being at a
third of your great English establishments he
had never spoken but twice to the head Master
of it? Don't I read of Oxford and Cambridge
time after time expelling the young lords and
high gentlemen, for every sort of misconduct
and disorder? What do <i>they</i> learn at the University,
but to gamble away their money, and
drink French wines? Sir, my notion is, that the
times are out of joint. Children don't respect
their parents and rulers. Parents and rulers
suffer children to get the upper hand, and think
themselves before their time, and without taking
the <i>trouble</i> to gain wisdom. The wholesome
restraint of the old school is out of fashion; bit
and bridle are taken off, and all the world scamper
in the way they like best; while, to crown
all the folly, the grandees are whetting knives
to cut their own throats.</p>

<p>"Suppose now, sir, that there was in all England, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
or any other country, but one single regiment
of men who had arms and ammunition;
and that it was the business of this single regiment
to protect the king, and stand sentry over
your banks, and prevent all commotions in your
capital. If neither gun nor pistol, a dust of
powder, nor a grain of shot could get into any
other hands, would not that regiment, of only
perhaps a thousand strong, be able to keep
down a multitude that we could hardly reckon?
but if the tower is opened, and a hundred thousand
stand of arms taken out, and given to the
people with plenty of balls and cartridges, and
they are drilled from morning till night, learning
all the new modes of squaring and filing off,
the new <i>this</i> and the new <i>that</i>, while the old
regiment does nothing at all, but stand as if it
was cut of paste-board, at the palace gates, and
the gates of your city; where will the rulers be
then? Why, to be sure, in the young and vigorous
recruits, who only wanted what you have
put into their hands to knock your train-bands
upon their faces on the ground, like the poppy
heads that some ancient warrior cut down for a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
sign to let the enemy know what he intended to
do."</p>

<p>"But Ned have we not some long heads in
Parliament that will keep watch over our interests?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, you have a few <i>long</i>, and a great
many <i>short</i> ones. Lord Liverpool is an honest
man and a sensible man. Mr. Peel is a man
that I believe would not tell a lie to make himself
a duke; and the greatest fault I see in him,
is that he is so fond of sporting, and so afraid
that any of poor Dick Martin's feeling for the
suffering dumb creation, should interfere with
his diversion, that he stifles the voice of humanity
within his breast; but it will not be so always,
I hope, for the best courage is ever to be
found in a tender heart. The lion and the
lamb, sir, make a fine mixture in a man's character."</p>

<p>"Then you think cruelty to animals a sin,
Ned?"</p>

<p>"Think it a sin!" replied Ned, with an expression
of countenance that would had have
brought thunders of applause at Drury-lane; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
"Yes, sir, it is a crying sin, and one of the very
worst signs of our time. It is a foul blot upon
our scutcheon. When I was a younker, the gentlemen
did not set their poor neighbours such
examples as they do now, and we see the fruits.
What right has a man, who is returning home
from a bull-bait himself, though he rides a fine
horse, and has ten thousand a year, to talk to an
ignorant savage that he sees on the high road
for goading a jaded bullock to market, or belabouring
an overloaded ass up the hill? or
what right has any man who encourages the
wicked amusement of prize fighting, which
teaches people to become brutes, and mangle
each other in cold blood, to abuse others for
doing the same in hot blood, when they meet
at a fair, and meet too as enemies who think
that they are <i>bound</i> to revenge some real or
imagined wrong? No, no, sir, preachers must
be <i>doers</i>, or they will only be laughed at."</p>

<p>"Whom else do you think well of in our
great National Assembly, Ned?" asked Bentley.</p>

<p>"Sir, I like Mr. Robinson. He knows his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
business. He found things in a bad condition,
and it is more troublesome to mend than to
make. He is going the right way to work, and
he is not frightened by opposition. Mr. Huskisson
too, sir, is a sensible man, and knows
what he is about."</p>

<p>"What say you, Ned, to Mr. Canning?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, I think that at all events he can
<i>talk</i> well, and I love him better for one thing
that he said the other day, than if he had given
me a hundred pounds in hand. Do you remember,
sir, when he defied the house to shew him any
act of liberality, any treaty upon a broad generous
foundation, that was not proposed by the
Tories. That was nuts and apples, to my
heart, for it was <i>truth</i>, and very well they all
knew it, for not a man dared to contradict him;
even Mr. Hume, who contradicts every thing
and every body, let <i>him</i> alone when he threw
that challenge in their teeth."</p>

<p>"You do not then like Mr. Hume, Ned.?"</p>

<p>"I should like him better, sir, if he took the
trouble of being better informed. He, sir, is
the watch dog in the orchard, but he barks so <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
often when no harm is at hand, or when he mistakes
a crow for a band of robbers, that when
the thieves come in earnest, people do not mind
him, and the uproar that he makes then, passes
by unheeded, which is a pity. However, sir,
he does some good, though not so much as he
might do, and the fear of <i>giving tongue</i> keeps
many a pilferrer out of the apple trees."</p>

<p>"Well, Ned, will it not be a fine thing for
Ireland, if we live to see the day when emancipation
is proclaimed, and all animosity, discontent,
and rebellion, are laid in the dust?"</p>

<p>Ned laughed heartily. "Wait a while," said
he, "and if we live to see that day I am a
pickled herring. No, sir, 'tis not because I am
no longer a <i>Roman</i> myself that I say it, but the
never a bit of good would emancipation do in
this country. The <i>name</i> of it indeed, would
make the people light fires, and drink a double
dose of whiskey, when they heard of it; and
they would shout, and those that have hats
would throw them up into the air. You would
have more noise, and drunkenness, and bloodshed,
and battery for a week or so, and when <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
that was over, and not a rap was to be found in
their pockets, or a tatter left on their backs, they
would begin to look about them, and ask one
another, what they had got? Whether the potato-garden
was lowered in its rent, or leather
in its price? Whether wages were raised or
the necessaries of life cheaper than they were
before; and when they discovered that all the
difference in their condition was, that Daniel
O'Connell and his partner Shiel, might stun
the House of Commons in London, with their
blustering speeches as they do now the Catholic
Association in Dublin; the people would find
that they had gained nothing but broken heads."</p>

<p>"But though it were only a shadow, a mere
name," said I, "if the people's hearts are set
upon obtaining it, will they not be happier and
more tranquil, if they succeed in the object of
their wishes?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, as to <i>wishes</i>, you may set an ignorant
multitude wishing for anything you please.
You might make them wish, like an infant,
for the moon, though they know no more about
it, than that it looks like a fine big Gloucester <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
cheese; but if the moon dropped down to them,
and they discovered that they could not neither
eat, drink, nor wear it; that it would neither
relieve them from tithe, nor cess, pay their rent,
nor manure the ground; nor, in fact do anything
but set a few learned men in the college talking
about the length and the breadth of it; I would
not go security for their being satisfied with
ther bargain. Sir, when people are set on wishing,
without knowing what they are wishing for,
it is well for them if it ends as well as the fable,
in a yard of good black pudding."</p>

<p>We were excessively amused by Ned's dry
sarcastic manner. Bentley continued: "I
think, however," said he, "that let Parliament
decide as it may, the bonds of affection between
landlord and tenant will be drawn closer by the
discussions that have taken place. The poor will
love the rich better from finding the sympathy
so general in their suffering, whether the wrongs
of which they complain be real or imaginary."</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir," answered Ned, with energy,
"the people are poor and wretched; they have
many wants and many grievances to complain <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of, but <i>those</i>, which their landlords might relieve
or redress are never thought about, unless now
and then by such a blessed man as Lord H. or
Mr. Otway. <i>They</i> make their tenants happy,
they treat them like Christians, and among <i>their</i>
poor people you hear no cant about emancipation,
they have enough to eat and drink, they
are encouraged in their industry, protected in
their rights, they enjoy all the freedom that
they require, and as much as is good for them.
But, sir, the <i>talking</i> landlords spend their breath
and spare their purses; and the people, who are
not such fools now-a-days as to be caught in
springes, know the difference between saying and
doing; they understand the <i>decoy ducks</i> much
better than you seem to suppose. I know a
great man, not a hundred miles off, who is
building a house as fine as Solomon's temple,
and he makes long speeches, and shakes hands
with every ragamuffin who can give him a vote;
but he is not a whit the better loved for all that,
and why should he? He is a hard landlord,
and they say that he makes his poor tenants
pull down their stone walls, and raise mud cabins <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
for themselves, that they may bring the
materials of their former habitations to help in
constructing his palace Ah, sir, words cost nothing,
and a poor man would depend more upon
the kindness that assisted him with a sack of
oatmeal, or a warm blanket, than upon all the
talk, empty and flourishing, that takes up the
newspapers, and gives the county gentlemen
the pleasure of seeing themselves in print.
When the people had not so much experience
as they have at present, it was easier to deceive
them; but you can hardly now 'find an old
weazel (as we say) asleep on his perch;' and
the <i>true</i> characters of the landholders are very
well known."</p>

<p>Then said I: "Ned, if you have many such
landlords, it is the less to be lamented that they
are so fond of going abroad. The absence of
such men is as good as their presence."</p>

<p>"No, sir, bad as they are, they could not
<i>help</i> being of some use if they stayed at home, and
spent their money in their own country. Never
believe any one who tells you that the absentees
are not one of poor Ireland's greatest curses."</p>

<p> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ned," said I, "while I listen to you, and
hear so many sensible remarks from your lips,
I cannot help thinking what a fine thing is universal
education, and how great a change <i>must</i>
be effected by learning which will enable the
mass of any nation to reason with the force
which you can bring to meet every subject that
we have discussed to day."</p>

<p>"Sir, I thank you," answered Ned, "for the
compliment, but I cannot return it without telling
a lie. <i>Your</i> reasoning, sir, is not of the
best, if you will consider the matter again, when
you would say, all as one, as that books make
brains. Why should the knowledge of reading
and writing, and casting sums in arithmetic
make wisdom amongst the poor, any more than
amongst the rich; and you have plenty of
dunces, sir, in the higher walks of life, who cannot
argue a bit the better for any thing that they
ever got hold of in school, or at college. But
even if learning gave understanding, which it
does <i>not</i>, for that is God's gift, still, sir, it might
be, with all its worth, not fit for <i>us</i> in our present
condition. If you gave me a barrel of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
best seed corn that your rich country ever grew,
I could not say but that it was a good gift, and
the grain fine grain; but if I threw it on the surface
of that barren rock yonder there, what return
would it make? Wouldn't it only bring
the mag-pies in flocks about me, to eat not only
that, but what little I had before? First, fence
in a bit of ground; then, burn it, and dig it,
and clear it; after that, you may sow your
grain, and it will come up and yield increase. In
like manner, sir, if you gentry would make your
tenants more comfortable, give them a little property
in their labours, encourage them to decent
habits, reward the sober and peaceable, punish
the bad, live amongst them, and employ them,
you would soon find your soil prepared for sowing
a crop which at present is thrown to waste,
or only devoured by birds of prey."</p>

<p>I could have staid till midnight with poor
Ned, and Bentley seemed rivetted in attention
to his acute observations and sound common
sense; but Frederick looked at his watch, and
gave the signal "to horse."</p>

<p>As we were moving towards the place where <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
our palfreys were in waiting, I said to Burke,
"tell me how is it that the mass of the people in
Ireland speak so much purer English than we
do, though it is <i>our</i> native tongue, and with you
<i>not</i> so?"</p>

<p>"That is the very reason of it, sir, I suppose,"
replied this extra-ordinary man. "You speak
English amongst your poor, as we speak Irish,
by ear, and so we speak it badly enough, and
differently in different places; but <i>our English</i>
we learn out of books, because it is <i>not</i> our natural
language, and so perhaps we may speak it
nearer to the manner in which it is written than
you do at your side of the water."</p>

<p>With intelligence thus superior to his humble
lot, did this <i>desert</i> "Hampden" (for "<i>village</i>"
would not suit with his desolate dwelling) discourse
with us till we were mounted. Frederick
made him promise to come to Glenalta,
where he told him that a present of books
awaited his arrival: and we promised to visit
him again on our return from Killarney. With
affectionate and mutual adieus, we parted, and
left the wide blank of a deathlike solitude and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
silence, to contrast with the merry din of our
voices and the cheerful shew of life which had
been produced by the group of men, dogs, and
horses, on the gloomy heath.</p>

<p>I shall never forget Ned of the Hill while I
live, and though his <i>brogue</i> is the <i>ne plus ultra</i>
of possible discord to a musical ear, I would rather
listen to him than to <i>almost</i> any <i>West-Endian</i>
of my acquaintance. Bentley is <i>beside
himself</i> with admiration of Ned, and I believe
would like nothing better than a cave next door
to our mountain sage, where some future bookmaker,
travelling this way, might set down the
neighbours as a settlement of the Troglodites,
who, by some wonderful chance, had been cast on
shore upon the coast of Kerry. I am not yet
sure how to classify Bentley. He is very worthy
of a place in my Irish Pantheon, but I have not
a niche ready for him, and as I hardly think that
I shall be able to unravel his character without
help, I will ask Mr. Otway about him, some
day or other, if I cannot satisfy myself respecting
certain incongruities which I perceive in his
manner.</p>

<p> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>As we neared Glenalta, Frederick observed
several traces of carriage wheels on the road,
and, on examining them more nearly, prophecied
that we should find company on reaching
home.</p>

<p>"Not at this hour, surely," said Bentley.
"Mr. Otway would not drive to Glenalta when
he is able to ride or walk thither; and my uncle
being an absentee at present, <i>who</i> is there
that could venture to pay a visit at five o'clock
with any hope of being at their more distant
homes in reasonable time for dinner?"</p>

<p>"Depend upon it," answered Frederick,
"that whoever came to Glenalta this day, is
there still. Like Cacus' den, it exhibits no returning
footsteps. All the marks of the horses'
feet are in the same direction." See what it is
to live in this out of the way sort of place!</p>

<p>The speculation of who could have come in
our absence kept our minds for the last mile in
the most animating state of inquiry and suspense.
We rode up directly to the stable-yard, on entering
which, a nice calêche and smart dennett
were drawn up in order. The stable-boy could <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
not tell more than that "<i>quality</i>" had come, and
old Lawrence, whom we met, could only add,
that they were to stay, and were <i>English</i>, but
every body was in such a bustle that, he told us,
he could learn no more. On entering the house,
we found the rooms deserted, and Fanny, who
came radiant with excitement, skipping down
stairs to meet us, was the only living thing that
presented itself to our view. To our eager inquiries
she would only reply, that we must go
and dress, and that when we appeared in the
drawing-room that we should know who were
the guests. There was no use in expostulating,
Fanny was inexorable, and to our toilettes we
were sent. As soon as mine was completed, I
hurried down stairs, and Fanny again was the
first to me. She took me by the hand, and
throwing open the drawing-room door, I found
my aunt, Emily, and Charlotte all dressed, and
looking full of some mystery, respecting which
I was proceeding to ask questions, when two
figures bounced from behind the large Indian
screen, and who should stand confessed before
me, but Russell and Annesley. Astonishment <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
was no adequate word to express what I felt at
sight of them. How to account for the vision,
how to express amazement, pleasure, at the unexpected
rencontre, I knew not. What a creature
of circumstance is man! Though I am
fond of both Russell and Annesley, and they are
the only people besides yourself, of whom I have
spoken as friends since I came here, and introduced
by character to my relations, yet a meeting
with either of them in the Regent's Park, in
Bond-street, at the Theatre, or the Opera, how
insipid! Nay, sometimes even a bore. Yet here
at Glenalta, county of Kerry, South of Ireland,
it was rapture to behold their faces, though neither
their personal identity nor my own can
have undergone any material alteration since we
met last at Cambridge. Is it that I, without
knowing it, have got a drop of Irish blood in my
veins, or that the features of my countrymen,
my schoolfellows, my College friends, operate
naturally in a strange place, like the <i>Ranz des
Vaches</i> on Swiss hearts in a foreign land? I
must leave you to develope the cause, I have
only to do with effects.</p>

<p> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>After the first tumult of surprise was over, I
gained in ten minutes the following outline respecting
the hows, whys, and whens of this sudden
incursion into the wilds of Kerry. From
the time when first Russell heard of my being
here, he began to devise a scheme for slipping
over in summer, but as his father wanted him to
join a party who were going to the Highlands,
he did not find it an easy matter to accomplish
his plan; having been told, however, by my
sisters, that I was <i>bound</i> to Killarney, he determined
on coming to Ireland; and, meeting Annesley,
offered him a seat in his dennett. The
project resolved on by these <i>wags</i> was, to keep
me in profound ignorance of their movements,
while they watched ours, and to meet us in some
romantic spot of our Lake scenery; but in pursuing
their route, they fell in with a travelling
carriage which had just <i>smashed</i> down in the
bog, and, having left all their English <i>sang froid</i>
behind them, they immediately jumped from
their own vehicle to make a proffer of every
assistance in their power to bestow. A lady,
her maid, and footman, were the party submerged <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
by fate beneath the murky waves of
Acheron. Literally they were all struggling out
of a dyke full of water as black as if it flowed
direct from the forge of Vulcan. The knights
flew to the rescue with all the zeal of chivalric
adventure, and conveyed their fair charge to a
neighbouring cabin, where a blazing fire, for
which they were indebted to the same morass
that had treated them so uncourteously, repaired
the evil, and set them moralizing on bogs and
bees, which, together with the bane, provide an
antidote. They found the lady very agreeable,
and moreover they discovered that she was steering
for Glenalta, upon which they drew up their
<i>visors</i>, proclaimed their names, and told her that
a friend whom they were seeking was a guest
under that roof. This coincidence pleased the
lady, as savouring of a regular adventure, and
she at once invested herself with the responsibilities
of a godmother, and (one good turn deserving
another) prevailed on her deliverers to
step into her carriage, and resign theirs to the
charge of her servant, promising to introduce
them to the Douglas family. Well now, you <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
naturally inquire who is the lady whose intimacy
at Glenalta warrants such a stretch of privilege?
She is a Mrs. Fitzroy, with whom my aunt became
well acquainted, during her long sojournment
in Devonshire, and whose society beguiled
her sorrows in the deep retirement of Linton.
Mrs. Fitzroy is a highly-gifted person, and a
most agreeable addition to our party; but to
proceed with my narrative, her visit was not a
surprise to my aunt, though a very great one to
the rest of the family.</p>

<p>A letter came just about the time when Emily
and Frederick had finished their works in the
Glen, and the unlooked for pleasure which they
had prepared for their mother, in introducing
her to the rustic temple which they had with
filial fondness dedicated to her, suggested the
idea of concealing Mrs. Fitzroy's intentions, and
thus repaying the young people in <i>kind</i>, by a
pleasant necromancy. Nothing could be better
managed, and my aunt enjoyed, to use the language
of old Du Deffand, a <i>grand succès</i>. I
was put in possession of all this before Mrs.
Fitzroy made her appearance. Frederick, who
came next into the drawing-room, was now informed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of all that had happened; and as to my
two English comrades, they were at home in a
quarter of an hour, a delightful reception for
them having been doubly secured by their <i>sponsors</i>.
Mrs. Fitzroy now completed our circle,
in which Mr. Otway and Bentley had previously
taken their posts, and a merrier group you never
saw.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzroy deserves to be distinguished by
a separate portrait, and therefore I must prepare
my canvass, and endeavour to sketch her
likeness. She appears to be about forty; her
features are well defined; replete with intelligence,
and when lit up by a gay expression, singularly
playful and pleasing. Her faculties are
strong and clear, her understanding comprehensive,
and her mind apparently equal to any exercise
of its powers which she chooses to put into
action. She is evidently possessed too of considerable
sensibility, which makes her peculiarly alive to
whatever is interesting in the character of others.
She and my aunt do not in the least resemble
each other, but the difference between them is
not such as to impede the growth of a very warm <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
friendship. The young people are excessively
fond of her, and her arrival at Glenalta is considered
quite a jubilee. Though an English-woman
by birth, and living almost continually
amongst people of her own country, all her sympathies
are Hibernian, and she has much of that
<i>raciness</i> in her own composition which she says
is so attractive a composition in the Irish. The
delight with which she goes into the cottages to
converse with the peasantry, is something very
amusing to witness. She says that, "Irish
thoughts are so <i>fresh</i>, and the expression of them
so eloquent," that she feels as if transported
amid a new order of beings. She seizes on every
idea, presented in whatever guise, with such intuitive
quickness, that she charms the poor
people in return, and Tom Collins paid her an
odd sort of compliment yesterday which brought
tears into her eyes: "Indeed, God bless your
honour, you're just as if you were bred and
born in the bog among ourselves." This is her
second visit to Ireland, though her first at Glenalta;
and she runs about in raptures collecting
traits of disposition which seem to have a native <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
affinity with her own. I shall tell you more of
her in a future letter.</p>

<p>We are to set out, a formidable <i>muster</i>, for
Killarney, at six o'clock to-morrow, and I shall
not seal this till the last moment, reserving my
next exclusively for a report of our expedition.
As I tell you every thing, I cannot conclude
without mentioning a letter which I have lately
received from my eldest sister, and which has
caused me much disquietude; she tells me that
my uncle the General is coming home from
India, which is fully confirmed by a letter direct
from himself to Mr. Otway, and it is my
mother's wish that I should be in England when
he arrives. What is still worse, there is an
evident anxiety expressed by Louisa, who, I
conclude, conveys the general feeling of the
family <i>conclave</i> in this case also, that I should
quit Glenalta directly. The rustication which I
am enduring will, she says, totally disqualify
me for polite society; my manners will become
boorish, my person <i>unsightly</i>, and, in short, it
is <i>voted</i>, that as it is supposed my health is perfectly
re-established, I shall quit my banishment, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and revisit the regions of civilization,
which it is apprehended I may forget, if my
recal be not speedy and imperative. Then certain
hints are thrown out respecting Adelaide,
and that ass Crayton, whose coronet, were it of
ducal form, and decorated with strawberry
leaves imported from Brobdignag, could never
hide the length of his ears. How short a time
has elapsed since these things which now perplex
would have given me joy? I should have been
thankful for a good excuse to bid adieu to Ireland
for ever; and I should have thought my
mother the first of human manoeuvrers, and
Adelaide the most fortunate girl in London to
have succeeded in <i>hooking</i> that first-rate blockhead,
who, it is likely, I am told, may be my
brother-in-law. Another subject of painful
reflection is added to these, and it is a relief to
my spirit to tell you <i>all</i> that oppresses it. Such
a change has taken place in my own mind, that
I see the character of others with new organs.
My personal identity almost seems doubtful to
myself, and I can hardly believe what is nevertheless <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
true, that Louisa's letter, independently
of the intelligence that it communicates, has
shocked me in a manner difficult to be explained
within my <i>own</i> breast, and scarcely possible to
be expressed intelligibly to another. My sister's
language is lively; she speaks of people familiar
to me, of amusements in which a few months
ago I used constantly to participate; of fears
and hopes, in all of which I could have sympathized,
and of events which would have excited
my vanity and gratified my pride. Surely it is
something savouring of magic that can have
converted these things into their very opposites.
You have often said that I was not formed for
the society in which I was placed; that my character
would have taken another direction had
it not been <i>trained</i> by habit to a distorted deviation
from its natural bias. Perhaps you were
right; but, allowing that you were so, still I
cannot account for the metamorphosis. Apply
a ligature that shall bind the branch of a tree,
or a limb of the human body, in any particular
curve, and there it rests. The bark, the wood,
the pith of the one; the muscles, tendons,
arteries of the other, obey the rule of distortion, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and the removal of restraint effects no alteration;
the crooked will not become straight.
On the contrary, here I am a changeling in my
mother's house; I see all objects with new
powers of vision, and such as, I lament to add,
render me ill satisfied with those who stand in
the relations to me which I have now learned
to appreciate. With a mind just awakened to
affection, and a heart just opened to the genial
influence of domestic love and harmony, my
feelings, which this soft climate of Glenalta has
unfolded, are blighted by the very thought of
Selby. Yes, I sicken at the bare idea of return,
and a consciousness which I only felt before
upon <i>great</i> occasions, now represents the
whole mechanism of that artificial compact
sealed by fashion in the most intolerable view to
my imagination. I cannot call things by their
old names; the words no longer appear to suit
their purposes, and the new nomenclature,
which now seems most appropriate, disgusts me.
How can I apply the terms bold, indelicate, unfeeling,
unaffectionate, to a <i>sister</i>, and not turn
with horror from such sounds; or attribute the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
base design of selling a child's happiness, carrying
a daughter to market, and disposing of
her to the best bidder, with all the cunning and
trickery of professed jockeyism&mdash;how <i>can</i> I
attach such devices to the character of a mother,
and not shudder as I write the word? Yet all
this is but an unexaggerated picture of those
relations, as I have hitherto known them; an
epitome of that world in which I have had my
being, and though a fugitive feeling, perhaps,
occasionally whispered disapprobation, and I
<i>have</i> now and then shrunk from certain violations
of modesty or integrity in the conduct of
those around me&mdash;such starts were but momentary.
I quickly rejoined the beaten track, and
pressed forward with the giddy throng. When
I look at my aunt Douglas, I feel how I could
worship such a parent. When I am with
Emily, Charlotte, and Fanny, I say to myself,
if I had such sisters how I could love them;
then comes the sting, I <i>have</i> a mother, I <i>have</i>
sisters, and my mind revolts from their society.
Poor Ned of the Hill told Bentley that "man <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
is <i>never</i> happy." He was right, Glenalta would
be Paradise did not the unwelcome intrusion of
such reflections disturb its felicity.</p>

<p>I was called away, or you might have had
more of my melancholy musings. We have
had a charming ride to-day, and seen some
<i>patches</i> of scenery so beautiful, that I can hardly
suppose any thing to surpass them at Killarney,
but like the fine beryls which were shewn to you
and me, that had been found in the Kremlin,
and looked as if they were set in a mass of
pewter, these favoured spots are surrounded
by such savage wildness as I can scarcely describe.
You could hardly imagine any part of
the dominions which own a British Monarch for
their Sovereign to present such desolation to
your view as met our eyes in this morning's excursion;
but now and then we lit upon an oasis
in the desert, the fertility and romantic loveliness
of which would teach the veriest wilderness
to smile. Annesley, who sketches admirably,
took some hints for his port folio, which will
astonish you some time or other. Emily and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Fanny were of our party, and are excellent
horsewomen. Our guests were delighted, and
we had another cheerful meeting at dinner, but
the evening was marked by a discovery which
has <i>knocked up</i> poor Russell's repose for <i>this</i>
night, I fancy, if not for a longer season. You
know his devotion to music, in which he excels,
and you are aware of his enthusiasm in collecting
national airs, amongst which he thinks none
so melodious as the old Irish strain. When the
harp and piano-forte were opened this evening,
we were listening to a <i>descant</i> of Russell's on
the favourite theme, when Frederick said, "I
<i>do</i> think Charlotte that you might now accompany
yourself. I saw you practising some days
ago, and never heard you touch the strings
more sweetly."</p>

<p>"I am only trying to recover a little of what
I have lost," answered Charlotte, "but, if
mamma does not say no, I will do the best that
I can. My old Irish airs are in the dressing-room,
will you bring them here?"</p>

<p>Till this moment I had never remarked that
Emily or Fanny had always accompanied, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
that Charlotte only joined in glees and duets,
which she sings with her brother and sister in
excellent style; but just before I came to Glenalta
she fell, as she was dismounting from her
horse, and hurt one arm so much, that it has
been ever since regaining its ordinary strength.
In any <i>other</i> family your ears would have been
persecuted from morning till night with the details
of such an accident. At Selby, I know
that Eau de Cologne, Arquebusade, and every
nostrum ever invented, would have been arrayed,
and there would have been an incessant
demand on the attentions of every mortal
throughout the house, but such is the difference
of education, that <i>self</i>, in all its branches, is
banished from Glenalta. I had nearly forgotten
that Charlotte was hurt, and as no one boasted
of her powers, I never heard a word of her
peculiar talent in music till in this unpremeditated
manner it was called forth by Russell's
dissertation on the character of Irish melody.
The book was brought, Emily saved her sister
the labour of tuning, and Charlotte, for the
first time, saluted our ears with such divine <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
enchantment as quite baffles every attempt of
mine to convey a sense of it to your imagination.
Russell furnished a <i>study</i> to Mrs. Fitzroy, who
was watching the variety of his emotion with
the deepest interest. His account of Charlotte's
music, perhaps, may give you the best
idea of it that words can impart:&mdash;"it is not,"
he says, "earthly harmony. No mortal finger
touches that harp; no human voice is uttered
in the song; that strain floats in mid air, and
the soft southern breeze has sighed through the
strings"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">
<div class="line">"'Twas the Genius of Erin that rose from her cave,</div>
<div class="line">And poured out her lament to the answering wave."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is not in nature to conceive any expression
of sorrow more penetrating than that which
mourns in the wail of an ancient Irish ditty.
Charlotte has contrived to procure several airs
which are not in Moore's collection, and which
carry internal evidence of antiquity in the irregularity
of their <i>rhythm</i>, if I may apply such a
term to music. No sea bird's note was ever
more sweetly sad; and she has picked up translations <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
from time to time of some poetical
fragments which she has adapted with great
taste, as well as judgment to the music, for
which she has often been indebted to the
peasants as they pursued their daily toil; not
that <i>they</i> sing agreeably in almost any instance,
I am told; the extreme barbarism which is induced
by such poverty as reigns in the South of
Ireland, is very unfavourable to the Muses;
yet they <i>will</i> linger amongst a people who possess
such uncommon tact in appreciating their
charms, notwithstanding the homely reception
with which they are obliged to be contented.
A death-song (<i>vulg. caöne</i> or <i>keen</i>), the words
of which, I believe, are published in a late work
on the Antiquities of this Kingdom, by Mr.
Croker, and which Charlotte has set to an old
<i>howl</i> that she heard a poor woman uttering
(for singing would be a misnomer) with nasal
twang, as she milked her cow, is the most heart-rending
melody that I ever heard; and a march
which she plays, to which the famous Brian
Boirombh led his troops forward at the battle of
Clontarf, is remarkable for a character of pathetic <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
grandeur that I never found before in
martial music. Russell's feelings underwent
such excitement during the evening, that had
not his sex preserved him from the simile, we
should have compared him to a Sybil in the
contortions of forthcoming inspiration. I now
perfectly comprehend the pleasure which, I am
informed, some of our first-rate public performers
profess in exhibiting their powers to an
Irish audience. The Irish feel music in the
"heart of heart," and express what they feel
with peculiar energy. Our English guests are
<i>bitten</i> I promise you; I heard them both emphatically
declare their gratitude to Mrs. Fitzroy
for her introduction to this "charming
family," but I <i>must</i> have a nap before we sally
out upon Lake adventures, so fare thee well.
On my return you may expect a budget.</p>

<h2>LETTER XV.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Miss Howard to A. Howard, Esq.</span></p>


<p>
Dear Arthur,
</p>

<p>Your letter of the 10th to me, has produced
a horrible combustion, and I am ordered to
recal you immediately. Well or not well, you
must be off; and as fast as coaching and steaming
can bring you it will be prudent for you to
appear before your angry parent, who will vent
all her bile on us, if you do not come and relieve
Adelaide and me from her ill humour.
She accuses us of having persuaded her into
consenting to your Irish expedition, and protests,
at the pitch of her voice, that she would
greatly prefer seeing you dead at her feet, to
beholding you return a methodist, which she is
convinced you are already become. You have
no time to lose; but lest you should not consider
the reception which I am teaching you to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
anticipate from your <i>tender mother</i>, too attractive,
I have another reason to urge for your
speedy appearance, which will surely turn the
scale, if you are in any doubt how to act. I
gave you a hint in my last, which will prevent
your being surprised with the sequel. <i>La mere</i>
has played her game so well, that were it not
for the dreams of affrighted fancy, which represent
you with parted locks of greasy sable,
mounted on a tub, and haranguing the multitude
<i>al fresco</i>&mdash;in short, if she did not believe
you in the high road to become a field preacher,
unless you are one already, she would have
reason to sound the trumpet, and claim the
honours of a triumph. She gave a splendid ball
by way of <i>clincher</i>, for which her cards where
out when I wrote last to you. The bait took
<i>à merveille</i>. Crayton and Ady waltzed together,
after which, mamma sailed round the rooms,
and whispered to three or four friends (good
telegraphs), that she wished Lord C. was not
quite so <i>particular</i> in his attentions. "<i>Le bruit
court</i>," so rapidly said <i>la bonne mere</i>, "that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
things are <i>settled</i> by the world before the parties
themselves have the slightest idea of being serious."
Of course you know the <i>eyes of Europe</i>
were directed to the pair. The buz went round,
and on the following day, old Lady Bilton bethought
her of a <i>cheap</i> return, for at least half
a dozen parties, and sent off a note to the following
effect, which mamma received before six
o'clock, at which hour Crayton made his morning
call to ask how we did. Old Bilton's <i>billet</i>
was to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Howard,&mdash;As no one can
possibly take precedence of me in the most lively
interest for all that concerns you, I have made
it a point to deny myself this morning to some
particular friends, that I may write, to tell you
of the rumours which are afloat. To be <i>explicit</i>,
Lord Crayton and Adelaide Howard occupy
the public mind, and the <i>on dit</i> of this morning
is, that the settlements are <i>en train</i>. Do say,
by a line, whether I may congratulate you. To
a girl of Adelaide's expectations, the report cannot
be of any disagreeable consequence if unfounded; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
but should it be true, I shall long to
hear particulars.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padding-right4">Yours very truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap padding-right2">S. Bilton."</span><br />
</p>

<p>No sooner was Crayton announced, than he
was caught and <i>closeted</i> by <i>la madre</i>, who imparted
Lady Bilton's intelligence with becoming
gravity, and sundry comments on the pain to
<i>delicate feelings</i>, produced by talking people;
the necessity of being more circumspect, her
own disinterested sentiments, desire for her
daughter's happiness, dread of Adelaide's affections
being engaged; all which matter, judiciously
interlarded with my uncle's great riches,
speedy return, devoted attachment to his brother's
children, and her own fears that his generosity
would be so profuse as to bring all the
fortune-hunting tribe to torment us, operated so
powerfully on my Lord, added to the surprise of
his <i>capture</i> on entering the house, that the
whole matter was arranged, Ady was sent for,
mamma vanished, the proposal was made,
and accepted, the horrid business-people are
put in motion, and you must come over, not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
only to take your seat amongst the musty parchments,
but likewise to go through the silly form
of giving your sister away. This latter ceremony
is much more appropriate to the old Indian
Plutus; but there are two reasons against
waiting his arrival. One is, that we are not
sure but he may leave us in the lurch; and,
secondly, he may possibly be such an outlandish
sort of animal, that we shall find it advisable to
keep him in the shade. Now, it <i>may be</i>, that if
you proclaim all that I am telling you, to the
tiresome <i>primitives</i>, whose notions you seem to
adopt with a degree of zeal, which I can assure
you gains no credit <i>here</i>, I dare say that the
eyes of your pious relatives will turn as naturally
to the <i>new</i>, as the sun-flower does to the
<i>old</i> light, and the blue, green, grey, or hazel,
which may distinguish the organs of your serious
aunt and cousins from each other, will be
lost in the general <i>field argent</i>, as their pupils
become heaven-directed, and the white of their
eyes alone remain visible, like the sculptured
orbs of so many statues. You will then hear a
volley of methodistic nonsence,&mdash;of "fraud," <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
"take in," "future unhappiness," and such
like mawkish stuff, which I protest makes me
feel, while I am writing, as if I had swallowed a
score of ipecacuanha lozenges; <i>therefore</i> it will
be wiser of you to say nothing of what I have
mentioned. It will be quite enough to tell Mrs.
Douglas and her gawky lasses, that affairs of
importance demand your presence in England,
and that, having been cured of your cough, the
object of your visit to them is accomplished.
We are the more anxious that you should act
promptly, because Russell, and that blockhead
Annesley, are gone to see Killarney, the Giant's
Causeway, and whatever other odds and ends,
in the way of <i>lionizing</i> that savage island may
offer. Now, if they <i>poke</i> you out from the hole
in which you are buried, or stumble upon you
in a bog, the ass, alias Annesley, will begin to
bray; he will tell the antediluvians of Glenalta
that Crayton is not exactly such a puritan as he
is himself; that he has gambled away money
enough to build four-and-twenty chapels all in
a row. Every irregularity of his life will be
dragged into notice, and as your <i>good</i> people <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
are stubborn as mules in performing what they
call their "<i>duty</i>," we shall have postage to pay
for some of your aunt's homilies, and not only
that, but folks who know nothing of the world,
act so entirely without line or compass, that I
should not be surprised if she took up her pen,
and committed the monstrous absurdity of addressing
a <i>tract</i> to Crayton himself.</p>

<p>To prevent such an absurdity must be our
care, and silence is the only plan to pursue with
your Kerry relations. If possible, your mother
will write a few lines herself, but lest she should
be hindered from doing so, I may as well mention
that Lady Araminta Sandes strongly recommends
a practice of which she has lately set
the example, insisting on the insertion of a
clause in every modern marriage settlement, to
secure a proper provision for the lady, in case of
a <i>separation</i>. I think the council <i>so</i> good, that
whenever it comes to <i>my</i> turn, I am resolved to
stipulate for at least a thousand a year.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Naresbury has fitted up her
<i>pallazo</i> in the best style, and intends to be very
splendid; but she will never <i>be one of us</i>, with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
all her endeavours. She is to be "at home"
on the twenty-first of next month, and Crayton
asked her permission to take young Fancourt,
who is just come back from his travels, along
with him to her house. The Duchess forgot
who he was, and when <i>Cray.</i> had <i>ticketed</i> him
like a geranium in the conservatory, "honorable
Augustus, second son to Lord Alison, a
very fine young man, and my particular friend,"
her Grace drew herself up with as much dignity
as if she was going to pronounce sentence, and
answered, "Lord Crayton, I make it a point
not to give any encouragement to younger brothers,
'tis a dangerous folly, of which sooner or
later one has to repent. I am sorry for it, but
I cannot make exceptions. I <i>cannot</i> receive Mr.
Augustus Fancourt." Now, the rule is certainly
<i>sound</i>, though this was rather an extreme case;
but you know that our charming Byron says,
somewhere or other,&mdash;I forget the lines,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">
<div class="line indent8">&mdash;&mdash;And pious mothers</div>
<div class="line">Inquired had they fortunes, and if they had brothers.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Well, Crayton was <i>piqued</i>, and as he would
have felt it quite a personal thing had he not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
succeeded in taking Fancourt to Naresburg-House,
he essayed again, and with great presence
of mind calmly replied, "I beg a thousand pardons,
for my presumption, but I thought your
Grace liked talents, and Fancourt is an acquisition
any where. He is just come from Greece,
and his <i>book</i> comes out in six weeks." "Oh!
that is <i>toute autre chose</i>," said the Duchess; "I
like clever people excessively. You know I
patronize authors, and have a host of <i>protegés</i>
continually about me. Lord Crayton, this is
quite another view of the matter. Pray bring
Mr. Fancourt; I shall be glad to see him, and
wish that he was <i>out</i>. He should have brought
his materials all ready for the press. He will
be late for the season in town. Tell him so
from me, and bid him print without delay. I
will speak of his book. I will announce it to
night at the Duchess of L&mdash;'s."</p>

<p>So ended the dialogue, and Cray. came off
with flying colours. I was interrupted here by
his entrance. Poor fellow! he looked pensive
I thought; but I fancy he had a double dose of
Burgundy at Lord Morley's yesterday, and <i>who</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
does not <i>wince</i> at sight of the sable squadron in
perspective, of those terrible law folks with
their long bills, and yellow faces? It was not a
week ago since Crayton was laughing heartily at
a monstrous sum which rich Burton of Norfolk
had to pay to his solicitors for some black letter
job. Amongst the items in account was, "To
anxiety for my client, March the tenth, two
pound fifteen." How very good! When the
affair was nearly at an end, old Burton thought
it would be a clever thing to spur Rosinante,
and accordingly ordered his coach and four to
stop, at the "special Attorney's," persuading
Mrs. Burton, that a <i>friendly call</i> on <i>market-day</i>,
carriage and liveries at the <i>door</i>, would diminish
the bill by a cool hundred at <i>least</i>. Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;
waddled out of the coach in a full suit of green
with yellow ribbons, like a walking bank of daffodils,
and spoke most condescendingly to Mr.
Pim and Mrs. Pim, and the Miss Pims, and the
Master Pims, but notwithstanding, and nevertheless,
the last entry in the account when it
came in was, "To a long and tedious conversation
with Mr. and Mrs. Burton, thirteen and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
fourpence." Crayton is so funny! He tells a
story when he is in spirits so well!</p>

<p>Here comes <i>La Madre</i> with her letter, and so
<i>Adio</i>. Adelaide would send her love, but we
are to <i>suppose</i> that she has none to spare. <i>By
and by</i>, I dare say, that she will have plenty on
hand; but that is <i>selon les regles</i>. The only
danger is, that what goes <i>out</i> love, may come
<i>back</i> hatred. Well, Rochefaucauld says, that
"hatred is distempered love," so 'tis all the same
thing in the end. I am growing <i>prosy</i>, but do
you know that the foolish story I told you in my
former letter has made such a noise, that I am
provoked, and shall begin to turn <i>blue</i> in earnest
to vex the blocks. Old Pagoda is at hand, or I
assure you it is well if my "Ostracism" were
not to send <i>me</i> into banishment. It was rather
an unlucky hit, half the young men in town do
not understand it, and it is voted a <i>poser</i>. Crayton
tells me that money is lost and won upon it
daily in St. James's Street. When my uncle is fairly
come, and I have touched the rupees, and golden
maures, I will positively not keep my wits under
<i>hatches</i> any longer. After all, it is egregious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
folly to give opiates to one's brains because our
exquisites are unfurnished in the upper story.
I must, however, take the matter quietly, for
<i>under</i> a hundred thousand, it will not do to use
a word of more than two syllables in length, or
<i>any</i> dimensions <i>at all</i> in <i>height</i> or <i>depth</i>; but you
shall see what revenge I will have when, like the
princess in the fairy tale, my "thread-papers
are made of bank-notes, and my favorite spaniel
drinks out of a diamond cup." I will then ransack
Johnson's <i>folio</i>, and oblige every aspirant
to come to my levees with the pocket Lexicon
in his bosom. Remember what I have said&mdash;mum
is the word. Let us not have a commission
to try whether we are of sane, or insane mind,
nor yet be forced, like Rodolpho, to seek our
wits in the moon, for I promise you we should
not find a Pegasus to mount so high now-a-days.

<h2>LETTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Howard to Arthur Howard, Esq.</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Inclosed in the preceding.</i>)</p>

<p>
My dear Boy,
</p>

<p>I am so full of business that I can only send
you a few lines. I rejoice to hear that you are
quite well, and that "Richard is himself again."
Come to me <i>directly</i>. Adelaide's approaching
marriage requires your immediate presence, and
as you are within a few weeks of your majority,
you will be able to enter into all my views for the
establishment of your sister. You know <i>what</i> a
mother I have been&mdash;how entirely devoted to
the interests of my children; and I hope, my
dear love, that I shall find you, on the present
momentous occasion, ready to give your best aid
in raising money for an immediate supply. You
will feel with me, the propriety of a suitable
outfit; and I am sure that it would be as painful <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
to your mind as to my own, were our dear
girl to want any proper accompaniment of her
new dignity. The Granvilles too (Crayton's
sister, you know is Lady G.) are people of such
connection, that we must make an effort extra-ordinary,
and I do not think it will be possible
to get through the necessary expenses for less
than five thousand pounds for present use. I
want you also on Louisa's account; and, <i>entre
nous</i>, feel very uneasy at a silly flight of her's the
other evening. She was in high spirits at our
Thursday's <i>soirée</i>, and imprudently <i>let fly</i> a
scrap of history. As <i>really</i> very few young men
now read any thing but the Morning Post, and
the Novel of the day, it is not surprising that
Louisa's learning confounded the party. I was
much vexed, but it cannot be helped. When
<i>you</i> come, you may be of use, in assuring all your
acquaintance that she has not a particle of <i>blue</i>
in her whole composition, and that the long
word which has made such a sensation, was
picked up from Blackwood, or the New Quarterly;
that she never reads history, and knows
no more of the Greeks than of a plum-pudding. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Nothing alarms me more, than the apprehension
of her taking to literature in a fit of disgust.
You see how much we have for you to do.
Commend me to Mrs. Henry Douglas and her
family. They are very good people I am sure,
and I feel much obliged by their attentions to
you. It is a great comfort when folks are doomed
to live in retirement, to see them enjoy it; and
nothing can be wiser than your aunt's determination
to remain in her present abode; but I
need not, my dear Arthur, I am <i>convinced</i>, impress
upon your mind the absurdity of taking
up such notions as are highly commendable as
well as suitable to Ireland, and confined circumstances.
You are born in another <i>sphere</i>
altogether, and must leave your Kerry ways behind
you. Lady Cantaloupe and the Comtesse
de Soissons just come! I must see them. Dear
Arthur,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padding-right3">Your affectionate mother,</span><br />
<span class="smcap padding-right1">Marianne Howard.</span></p>

<p>P.S. I had a great deal to say of my dear
brother the General, but will postpone. <i>Au
revoir.</i></p>

<h2>LETTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Arthur Howard to Miss Howard.</span></p>

<p>
Dearest Louisa,
</p>

<p>On my return from Killarney, I find your
packet, and hasten to say to my mother and you,
that I shall obey your summons with as little
delay as possible, consistently with all that I owe
to the beloved friends whom I am about to leave.
So many conflicting thoughts press for utterance,
that I know not how or where to begin.
Louisa, you will find me a very different being
from the Arthur of your recollection; and I
fear that at first the change which has been
wrought in me will not please you. If you disliked
my friendship with Falkland, and less
powerful, yet still strong, regard for Annesley,
what will you think of a devotion which can
only end with life for my aunt Douglas, her
children, and her friend Mr. Otway?</p>

<p>Yes, I own it to you. At Glenalta, in this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
despised and remote corner of Ireland, which
you and I have so often ignorantly ridiculed, I
have met with the most perfect happiness which
it has ever fallen to my lot to enjoy. At Glenalta
I have found the kindest affection, the
most genuine refinement, not confined to mere
exterior observance assumed for strangers, but
originating in the heart, and living in every action.
I have been instructed and amused; and
while each hour has done something towards the
cultivation of feelings and powers which I did
not imagine I possessed, I have never been once
a prey to <i>ennui</i>, that constant and wearisome associate
of my former life.</p>

<p>Dear Louisa, you have a good understanding
and your heart is naturally lively, and even <i>kind</i>,
if you were not perverted by the precepts,
creeds, and example of that most dogmatizing
of all human teachers&mdash;Fashion. Why not
break the bonds that shackle your every thought,
as well as action? Why not exchange the
coarse, (alas, yes, I <i>must</i> speak truth) I say the
coarse, unfeminine language of your last letter
for that of true delicacy and female softness? <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
My ears are new strung I suppose, for sounds
which scarcely made a passing impression before
I came to Ireland, now grate upon the organs
of sense, and vibrate painfully to my heart.</p>

<p>When I picture to my mind the scene which
is now acting in Grosvenor Square, I confess
that I feel disgusted almost to estrangement from
those who are the chief performers in such a
drama; and you are very right in the belief
that were there any means by which without
lowering a mother's character, I could inform
that <i>arch</i>-blockhead, whom she has entrapped,
of the fraud that has been employed to take him
in, I would certainly, in humbling his vanity,
remove his blindness, and charitably catch him
from the brink of a precipice. What a marriage
you are <i>brewing</i> amongst you! Were <i>you</i>
the victim about to be sacrificed on the altar of
folly, I could not restrain my feelings, which
would burst into immediate counteraction of a
plot to destroy all happiness and respectability;
and I am more quiescent on <i>this</i> occasion, <i>not</i>
because I have always loved you so much better
than Adelaide, but that I question the utility of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
endeavouring to snatch <i>her</i> from the evil to come.
She has no strength of character: her mind is a
mere machine, ready and willing to be worked
upon by the arts of any juggler who can produce
a certificate of skill in the only science respected
by a world holding all things in abhorrence
that do not present themselves clad in the
trappings of rank and fortune.</p>

<p>If Adelaide were saved from falling into the
hands of <i>one</i> profligate coxcomb, she would
quickly throw herself into the arms of <i>another</i>.
Crayton is not a designing man, and that is the
only redeeming circumstance that I can see in
his character&mdash;if the word character have any
meaning when applied to a person who has
<i>none</i>.</p>

<p>Say to my mother that, as a point of duty, I
shall obey her mandate, and as soon as I am legally
empowered to act, will do any thing to assist
her which can be done without injuring a
property too heavily burthened already. But,
dear Louisa, you must prepare her, Adelaide,
and yourself for my absence at the marriage ceremony:
I cannot perform the part assigned to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
me. My mind revolts from participating in a
<i>trick</i>, and I will never sanction the fraud by
becoming a witness. I warn you of the evil,
and I can do no more. We are totally unacquainted
with my uncle, who may never give us
a shilling, who may dislike when he is acquainted
with his relations, and either marry, adopt a
stranger for his heir, or leave his wealth to public
charities. In short, we know nothing about
him, and if it should turn out that the golden
dreams with which my mother has dazzled the
imagination of a man who has wasted his patrimony,
and involved himself almost in ruin, melt
in empty air, what consequences may not be
anticipated? I turn with horror from the perspective,
and dare not tell you <i>all</i> my fears!
Crayton has an uncle too, and one from whom
he expects the fortune, upon a reversionary hope
of which, he has, to my knowledge, been trading
for a long time past to supply the exigencies
of the gambling table, to which he is obstinately
addicted; and the pale face which you visited
on a double dole of Burgundy, was probably
attributable to a loss at play which, under existing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
circumstances, it would not be pleasant
to reveal.</p>

<p>I have now said enough to put my mother
and Adelaide on their guard. A little <i>candour</i>
would easily bring the matter to a conclusion,
and prevent the mischief which is likely to ensue;
but it rests with them to determine. I am
not asked to advise, and do not say that I am
qualified to act as counsel for any one. I trust,
however, that I may be forgiven for this unsolicited
interference, on the score of brotherly feelings,
which <i>shrink</i> from the projected alliance,
splendid as it appears.</p>

<p>Louisa, should the day arrive, in which you
become acquainted with the Douglas family, I
am not without hope of your proselytism.
What joy it would give me to see you like these
charming girls, and I am the more impatient
that it <i>should be so</i>, because you have all the
materials which might promise a rich harvest,
were they but used to advantage. I would
stake more than I shall ever be worth, that you
will delight in the society of our aunt and cousins, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
if you are ever introduced to them.</p>

<p>Say all that is affectionate to my mother and
Adelaide, and add, that I give them present pain,
to avoid for them a severer future pang. Adieu.</p>

<h2>LETTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Arthur Howard to Charles Falkland.</span></p>

<p>
My dear Falkland,
</p>

<p>I commence my Killarney <i>advices</i> on the
first evening of my arrival there, or I should
despair of sending you the promised packet on
my return to Glenalta. We reached our inn
in gay spirits, having come over bad and good
roads alternately, and through a barren wild
looking country; but a party, composed of such
agreeable ingredients, and affording so much
variety as ours did, is very independent of external
scenery. If beautiful, it affords an additional
source of pleasure, and <i>one</i> topic more
for occasional comment; if otherwise, one can
<i>do without</i> it: the latter was our case. Having
once exclaimed, How desolate! we thought no
more about the grievance of an ugly country,
but laughed and talked, exchanged places&mdash;some <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
riding, some driving, till we found ourselves
at our journey's end, after performing
five-and-thirty miles without any misadventure.
Mr. Otway had written on before to provide
"entertainment for man and horse;" so when
we arrived we had the satisfaction of finding
ourselves <i>expected</i>, which makes a <i>difference</i>
everywhere, but particularly in a situation
which cannot afford to relax in a single instance
the discipline which keeps up some appearance
of order and cleanliness; however, I
do not mean to throw aspersions on our <i>hotelerie</i>,
and am not one of those who consider it fair
to abuse unmercifully whatever we find near
home, while with something <i>more</i> than philosophy,
we <i>revel</i> in the <i>desagrémens</i> of foreign
countries, preferring dirt and inconvenience
abroad to all the luxuries of <i>comfortable</i> England.</p>

<p>In ten minutes after our arrival we were assailed
by all sorts of people; boatmen wishing
to engage our large party, musicians desirous
of attending us on the lakes, beggars
hoping to receive charity, with sundry applicants <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
bringing boxes made of the red deer-hoofs,
which are very neatly manufactured here,
and various cups, goblets, and other utensils
formed from the arbutus, which grows at this
place in lavish profusion; all anxious to sell
their wares, and all clamorous to recommend
them.</p>

<p>Mr. Otway, who knows the genius of the
place, and is well known here and loved everywhere,
undertook to direct our operations;
and, singling out a remarkably fine looking
man from the rough personages by whom we
were surrounded, addressed him by the name
of M'Carty More, and ordered him to be ready
with all possible punctuality and accommodation
at seven o'clock on the following day at
Ross Castle, where we were to embark. The
workers in red deer-hoofs and arbutus, were
ordered to bring large supplies of the toys in
which they dealt on the day preceding our
departure, and the beggars were dispersed
with a promise that they should have <i>a scramble</i>
when we were going away, for which these
ill-fed, worse clothed, cheerful, and easily-satisfied <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
beings, were as grateful as if every want
had been supplied at the present and prevented
for the future.</p>

<p>After this <i>clearance</i>, we sat down to a repast
rendered delightful by companionship, had it
been less intrinsically excellent; but Killarney
salmon ought to have a place in my journal,
and should be farther noticed <i>here</i>, were it
not not to figure on the scene again. After
dinner we walked to Lord Kenmare's, and
amused ourselves in his demesne, during two
or three hours, my aunt having insisted on
our leaving her at the inn, as she complained
of being fatigued; and those who were best
acquainted with all her feelings, suspecting
that to be left <i>alone</i> would soothe them, no
offer was made to remain with her by any of
the group.</p>

<p>On our return to the inn, we were surprised
to find an elderly gentleman sitting with her,
who proved to be old Bentley, and never did
I see more evident annoyance expressed in a
countenance, than was depicted in the nephew's
at sight of his uncle. They met, however, with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
cordiality <i>too</i>, but the younger of them, though
singularly unexcitable in general, changed
colour upon the present occasion, and appeared
suddenly cast down by this accession
to our party: however, we were sufficiently
numerous to prevent any <i>downright</i> awkwardness,
whatever might be the existing cause of
young Bentley's uneasy sensations; and his
uncle explained his sudden appearance by telling
us, that having reached his home too late
on the preceding evening to disturb the families
at Glenalta and Lisfarne, he delayed announcing
his return till the following day, when,
having learned our <i>elopement</i>, he resolved on
not being left behind.</p>

<p>You may fancy us rather closely packed in
our <i>dormitories</i>: Russell, Annesley, and I, were
crammed into a hole just large enough to
hold three small camp-beds, no bigger than
births on board a Holyhead packet: we could
neither toss nor tumble, for the best possible
reason, we had not <i>room</i> for such indications
of restlessness; but we lay quietly as sleeplessly
we "chewed the cud of sweet and bitter <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
fancy" upon all that we had seen and heard
in company with each other since the "<i>English
foreigners</i>," as old Lawrence calls them,
had been at Glenalta. In the pauses which
will occur, even in the best supported colloquy,
sundry sighs, which had not quite so far
to travel as from "Indus to the Pole," were
borne right into my bed by the <i>impetus</i> with
which they were sent from Russell's, and a certain
melancholy expression, which even a sigh
can convey to a <i>finely constructed</i> ear, convinced
me that my friend had lost his heart,
or at least <i>mislaid</i> it since he came amongst
us. While exercising my ingenuity a little
farther, to determine the person who had committed
grand larceny on his affections, a few
notes whistled from time to time, <i>sotto voce</i>,
assured me that Charlotte was the thief, and
that her Irish melodies lived in the memory of
my poor <i>chum</i>. Annesley is such a sensitive
fellow, that if his heart is anything the worse
for the wear since he came to Ireland, I have
it to discover; but from the specimen which I
have given above, I flatter myself that you <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
have already decreed my sagacity to be worthy
of apotheosis, even amongst the North American
Indians.</p>

<p>This Killarney will be a good test, I think,
of our amatory tendencies, and a romance
<i>a-piece</i> must be the result of such "means
and appliances" as a glance from Lord Kenmare's
park, across the lower Lake, promise
for our <i>coup d'essai</i> on the morrow. Mine is
rather a situation of responsibility, for, in addition
to my <i>own</i> loves, should these bowers
inspire the tender passion, I feel a God-fatherly
sort of security called for on my part,
that the new guests shall conduct themselves
so as to return well pleased, and pleasing, to
the last. In short, though, like Mrs. Gilpin
we are "on pleasure bent," it must be to resemble
her discretion also, "with a prudent
mind," and I clearly perceive that I shall have
to enact the part of a male <i>duenna</i>.</p>

<p>The appointed hour found all ready, and
M'Carty More, that noble <i>savage</i> before-mentioned,
who claims to be king of the boatmen,
was the first object that we beheld on issuing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
from our <i>malapardis</i>. This man is quite a
character, and so strikingly fine a specimen
of rude, but manly beauty, that were he a
little less weather-beaten, he might stand for
a Hercules to Canova, were he alive again, or
to Chauntry. His <i>calling</i> renders him quite familiar
with his superiors, and he takes the
command of his party as a pilot does of the
ship, <i>pro tempore</i>. Mrs. Fitzroy, whose animation
is very inspiriting, and whose enthusiasm
I told you in a former despatch is glowing
for the Irish character, chose him for her
<i>Cicerone</i>, and, taking him by the arm, led the
van towards the scene of embarkation.</p>

<p>If you wish to know, as that mad-cap Melville
used to say, "who and who were together,"
you may <i>enfilade</i> us as follows. Next to
M'Carty More and Mrs. Fitzroy marched my
aunt, leaning on the arm of Frederick, who,
I believe, in the midst of all the beauty that
Circassia could boast, and all the fashion that
London and Paris exhibit, would still be found
his mother's prop: on her left side Bentley the
elder with his hands tight in his breeches <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
pockets, as though he feared that their contents
were going to fly away, <i>paddled</i> along, with unequal
steps. Mr. Otway took charge of Emily;
and I observed that a simultaneous movement
of that slow and fearful nature that scarcely
indicates design, incited at the same identical
moment Bentley the younger and Annesley
to wish that the disengaged hand of my cousin
were safely lodged under the protective care
of a right arm belonging to them, though neither
had courage to step forward and offer
himself as a candidate for the honour to which
both aspired. Moreover I made a second observation;
and though these sapient remarks
were formed <i>in transitu</i> from the threshhold of
the inn to the street, I'll be sworn that I am
right. "But what was your second observation?"
quoth you. Why, it was, that the
<i>mauvaise honte</i> which prevented our rival <i>beaux</i>
from interfering with Mr. Otway's exclusive
possession of the fair one's attention, arose from
different causes, and produced different effects
in the minds of the disappointed knights.
Annesley's timidity lay in his breast, where, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
if he has made the confession to himself, he
has truly said that Emily's is the character, of
all he has ever seen, which comes nearest to his
abstract of perfection in woman. On this <i>beau
idéal</i> I have heard him dilate, and thus far can
decide upon his feelings. <i>He</i> then was moved
by an incipient desire to improve acquaintance,
and secure a sort of prescriptive right to be
Emily's <i>particular</i> in our wanderings by "wood
and lake;" but the thought, though proceeding
from preference established since the day of his
arrival, was an <i>impromptu</i> of the instant in its
present shape, and the reality of the sentiment
which gave birth to the wish, confounded its
ready expression; whereas in Bentley's manner
I could trace more of the guardian than
the lover; he was less anxious to appropriate
Emily's society exclusively to himself, than to
prevent its being appropriated by another, and
this again was less dictated by a jealous or
churlish feeling, than by a strictness of opinion
on the subject of a young lady's walking
arm-in-arm with a stranger. All this I read at
a glance, and perhaps you will tell me that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
such profound skill in what the French call <i>le
metaphysique de l'amour</i>, could only be learnt
in Cupid's court; but the fact is, that I am
<i>only</i> in love with the entire family, and therefore
safe for the <i>present</i>, at least, from the imputation
of having been a <i>booby</i> till the blind
god had sharpened my penetration.</p>

<p>Charlotte and Fanny were hooked upon my
arms; Russell keeping a steady eye upon the
former's left side, which he contrived to secure
as soon as we had cleared the door; and our
brace of <i>shy</i> youths were presently resolved into
<i>unattached flankers</i>, who changed sides, fell back,
or pushed forward, as pigs, dogs, children, &amp;c.
interrupted our progress to the water's edge.
At length we were seated in our barge, and
Cleopatra on the silver Cydnus could never
have swung the oar more gallantly than we did
from Ross Castle. I shall not favour you with
the history of tenfold reverberations, which you
will hear when you visit this scene of enchantment;
nor shall I think it necessary to give you
such details as if I were going to raise the wind
in these book-making days by publishing, "A <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Companion to the Lakes of Killarney," but
hastening to our first <i>stop</i>, land you on the exquisite
island of Innisfallen, where we lingered
for hours, unable to tear ourselves from its tiny
shores, every little pebbled indenture of which
might represent that where Ellen is described
by the northern bard to have landed from her
skiff in Loch Cattrine.</p>

<p>This Killarney is a centre of legendary lore,
and the lovely islet on which we first touched
<i>terra firma</i> from our boat, was the depository of
those annals which bear its name. Domine,
who did not appear in our procession from the
inn, because he had walked alone to the castle
that he might try the echo at his leisure before
we came up, told us a thousand interesting particulars
of this spot, and entertained us with various
stories, rich in fabulous, as well as real
events, of the olden time. Why does not that
wizard Scott, draw from a source so worthy of
his magic pen? He has been here, but passed, I
am told, through Ireland gnerally with such
rapidity, that his carriage wheels hardly seemed
to come in contact with the earth. Positively, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
unless he can endure it to be thought that with
a few lithographic sketches in his hand, he
skimmed over the country, contracting for
views <i>as per sample</i>, like a corn merchant bargaining
to replenish his stores, the author of
Waverly <i>must</i> shew signs of having visited this
little focus of imagery by dressing one of his
matchless casts in the drapery with which Killarney
could furnish his splendid powers of
tasteful decoration.</p>

<p>Will that genius, who can transform into
gems the commonest minerals produced in a
desert, and give with African prodigality, the
purest gold in return for rusty nails, and beads
of glass; will <i>he</i> permit Erin to draw the ungracious
inference from his silence, that she
could supply <i>no</i> materials for his laboratory? and
while so many immortal records of Scotland's
fame and England's glory, have been charmed
from their dark retreats by his necromantic
spells, shall Ireland, the fertile Isle of Emerald
glow,&mdash;the island of saints,&mdash;the land of
heroes,&mdash;the fane of learning, piety, and music,
&mdash;be left to rest on the divided property in Fingal <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
for all poetical memorial of her traditional
celebrity? Forbid it justice! forbid it gratitude!
Let not a people who have so liberally
bestowed their praise on those numbers in
which their neighbours have been so sweetly
harmonized, remain themselves unsung!</p>

<p>Some of our party eloquently urging the
claims of Hibernia to a niche in the temple
of Apollo, Russell, addressing himself to Mr.
Oliphant, said, "I hope that you will not
mistake my object in asking you a question
which I have often heard triumphantly asked,
and never answered, namely, if Ireland was
really, at a former peroid distinguished as a
seat of learning, virtue, and genius, where are
her credentials? What is become of her buildings?
Where are her documents of proof to
support these fond pretensions? Now I echo
this inquiry not in the spirit of a sceptic, but
because I can never in future listen to such interrogatories
with the phlegm of indifference,
and I wish to be provided with an argument to
rebut the conclusion which is frequently drawn <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
from silence on this subject."</p>

<p>"Indeed, my dear sir," answered Mr. Oliphant,
"I have always thought the question
very irrelevant, and the triumph very unfair.
If we boasted that Ireland had produced the
finest architects in the world, we might be desired
to shew the monuments of their skill. If
we arrogated the fame of wealth, we might be
challenged to point out the palaces in which
the splendid of past days had held their revels;
but we lay claim to none of these things. Our
pride consists in having been a learned and
pious people. Now piety and scholarship are
not so often allied to worldly distinction in <i>this</i>
age of mankind, that we should associate them
in a <i>past</i> time through any existing analogy.
That Ireland was resorted to for education;
that she produced men remarkable for knowledge
and virtues; that her <i>magi</i> were held in repute
and invited into other countries, to impart
the treasures of superior light; that her ambassadors
took precedence upon different occasions,
of those sent by the sister kingdom, to continental <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
courts and councils, are matters of historical
record which we have no right to contradict,
unless we can prove their falsehood; and as
to the remnants of antiquity, which are insisted
upon, we may collect ample testimony to evince
a high state of former cultivation, if we make
due allowance for poverty, subsequent civil
wars, and the dilapidating influence of a damp
climate. The language of Ireland bears evidence
of ancient date. Every letter in the alphabet
is in itself <i>the name of a tree</i>, which leads
to the inference of originality in its design. The
round towers of this country, many of which
are in the highest state of preservation, baffle
the utmost skill in research to account for their
purpose, and determine their age. Of one
thing only are we certain, and that is, of their
great duration, and that, as far as present information
extends upon the subject, Persia is the
only country, besides Ireland, where buildings
of this remarkable structure have been found.
Our Druidical remains are in fine preservation,
in various parts of the island. The names of
several of our elevated promontories, with other <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
circumstances, mark the fire-worship of eastern
usage to have prevailed here. In many parts of
the kingdom, ornaments in gold and silver have
been discovered, of the purest metal, and most
elaborate workmanship. I have seen some
lately that were dug up in the neighbourhood
of Dublin, which, for beauty in execution and
elegance of device, may vie with any modern
manufacture, and which, likewise, are identified
with eastern fashion, as the decorations to which
I allude were exactly similar to the Indian
bangles, and must have been employed as such,
to deck the ancles of the wearer. In our search
after mines, we have come upon ancient excavations,
and often found tools of brass which bore
testimony to the former working in different
places, and at a period so remote that the instruments
used for the purpose are formed of a
material, and exhibit shapes totally unlike any
of our modern implements. In this very county
are to be found curious remains of two spacious
amphitheatres which, if discovered in any other
country of the earth, would excite the liveliest
competition of industry to explain; but because <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
these things are discovered in Ireland instead of
Tartary or Siberia, ridicule and contempt are
their portion. However, as the one flows from
ignorance, and the other from coldheartedness
or jealousy, and neither affords demonstration,
we may hope that they will cease, and that a
land, too fertile of soil, too rich in the finest
harbours in Europe, to have been overlooked in
early times, will regain her character which has
been lost through the misfortunes of her history.
You must bear in mind that in the very remote
periods of which our accounts are scanty and
imperfect, the religion of this country was not
Roman Catholic. It was a much purer faith,
and free altogether from those superstitions
which now disfigure the Popish ritual. The
poor Waldenses in their vallies of Piedmont,
though they have lost much of their original
simplicity in a necessary communion from time
to time with the Protestants of Geneva, still
preserve, I believe the nearest approach of any
mode of worship extant, to what <i>was</i> our creed
about the time of Saint Patrick, whose <i>purgatory</i>
was instituted many centuries after his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
death. In <i>those</i> days then, the magnificent
piles which owe their existence to the zeal of
papal devotion, would not have been erected
here, whatever might have been the pecuniary
abundance of the people; and at a later time,
when abuses crept in, and the pure faith was exchanged
for that inconsistent mass of human invention
appended by bigotry and avarice to gospel
truth, Ireland was too poor, and too savage
a nation, to raise such mighty altars as bear witness
to the former wealth and glory of your
beautiful England.</p>

<p>"<i>Some</i> remnants we do possess of ancient
grandeur, and we can still shew you specimens
both of Saxon and Gothic architecture, which
are worthy of your highest admiration, though
they not numerous, I confess.</p>

<p>"Lord Elgin has transplanted much of the
Athenian Parthenon into the heart of London;
what he left, is daily suffering deterioration,
and diminution. If the pride of Greece, the
classic, the inimitable Athens, should vanish,
and, like the Golgotha of Troy, only exhibit the
<i>place</i> where once stood in unrivalled grace and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
splendor, would you not still declare that her
temples and her statues, though crumbling in
the dust, proclaim that Pericles and Phidias
<i>once</i> had being.</p>

<p>"If but a single column of the once astonishing
Pæstum now survived the decay of time
and the barbarism of man, would you suffer incredulity
to take her stand amid the ruins, and
fulminate her tasteless anathemas from the very
scene of whilom greatness? <i>We</i> only crave a
measure of the same candour which you liberally
employ on other occasions. Let our
round towers and cromlechs, our castles and
abbeys, be allowed in evidence of our not being
a nation just sprung from the sea; and suffer
our annals and chronicles to be received in testimony
of our having sent forth pious and
learned men, when less favoured countries
sought our assistance. Come now, and I will
shew you a fine Saxon arch in this wee island."</p>

<p>As we moved on towards the ruin, we found
some of our party gazing on the lake below,
from a little rocky eminence on which they were
seated, and here we caught Mrs. Fitzroy and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
old Bentley in furious debate. He is an odd
sort of <i>restive</i> old fellow; sharp, clear sighted,
and very bitter in his remarks; but withal good-natured,
and, though rough, by no means implacable.
Mrs. Fitzroy had been, I suppose,
expressing some sentiment in favour of the
Irish peasantry, perhaps in praise of the Herculean
M'Carty; for just as we reached the
spot where the antagonists were contending,
Bentley exclaimed with stentorian vehemence,
"Madam, I tell you that they are rascals, one
and all. It is a mere fiction to talk of the Irish
as you do. I know them better. They are a
cringing lying race; and as to your admired
M'Carty More, he is a drunken dissolute dog;
and you spoil him by letting him prate for your
diversion."</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Mr. Bentley," answered
his adversary, "your abuse is wholesale, and
spreads over too large a surface to cut deeply.
I do not agree with you; and I repeat, that
such is my preference for the people of this country,
that I shall beg my friends Mrs. Douglas
and Mr. Otway to be on the look out for a cottage <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
to suit me in their vicinity at Glenalta."</p>

<p>"No, no, madam, you will do no such thing,"
retorted the cynic; "you are acting more
wisely. Believe me, that the most knowing
people are those who <i>travel about, if society be
their object</i>. By change of place, you come in
for the best of every stage at which you halt.
You skim the cream as it were, and ought never
to rest long enough any where to alter your opinions
of people, very few of whom, be assured,
will stand the test of intimacy. There is nothing
truer than that Alexander was no hero to
his valet-de-chambre, and the maxim applies as
forcibly to nations as to individuals. You will
tire of us, if you know us better, and look back
upon your present judgment as mere poetry.
Every oyster is made up of the fish and its
shells. Swallow the one and get rid of the
others as fast as you can: they are not worth
keeping, and you will do well to throw them
away."</p>

<p>"Not with <i>my</i> charitable feelings," said Mrs.
Fitzroy, "pounded oyster shells are a fine corrective
of acid. I would reserve them for the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
good of all who require alteratives, and you
should have a Benjamin's dose."</p>

<p>Old Bentley is a merry wight, with all his
acerbity, and as this <i>hit</i> was made with perfect
good-humour, and a playful countenance, it had
a happy effect, and seemed to raise his estimation
of the powers of mind opposed to him.</p>

<p>"Madam," answered he, "I thank you for
your desire to make me better, though your
<i>sweetners</i> should not succeed. I pique myself
on seeing things as they <i>are</i>, and set my face always
steadily against every species of romance."</p>

<p>In so saying, he gave a consequential <i>hem</i>,
and turned his eyes towards "poor George,"
his nephew, whose nerves are, luckily for himself,
not externally perturbable, and though I
am certain he <i>felt</i> that "more was meant than
met the ear," he continued, as calmly as possible,
to converse with my aunt, whom he had engaged
in a <i>tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p>We were now reminded by M'Carthy More
that Innisfallen was only the beginning, not the
end of our progress; and, regaining our barge,
we were again embarked. This may be a proper <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
place to tell you, lest I should forget it here-after,
that to prevent any unavailing efforts on
your part at tracing the pedigree of so great a
personage as the said King of our Killarney
lake-men, the word <i>More</i>, which appears like a
sirname, is in reality the Irish for <i>Great</i>, as <i>Beg</i>
is for <i>Little</i>: so that M'Carthy More means
the great or chief M'Carthy.</p>

<p>We now bent our course towards Glena. If
you were not coming one of these days to see
with your own eyes, and hear with your own
ears, the wonders of this little elysium, I should
send you my journal at once, where almost every
tree is registered as if I were an Irish tenant,
and had planted them myself; but of description
you will not have much in my letter, or it
would swell to a volume; and, as it is, you would
be bankrupt, were it not for your good luck,
which again presents a private opportunity of
sending a packet to you.</p>

<p>At Glena we landed, and here the arbutus
arrested our steps, and fixed the party for some
time in amazement at its quantity and size.
Here too, our <i>Monarch</i> informed us that we <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
should fish for our dinner, inviting us to watch
the process of drawing a net. Broken into
groups, we seated ourselves along the margin of
the lake, and I for one could have believed myself
translated into some happier region, <i>at least</i>
intermediate between heaven and earth. As I
muttered something to this effect, I heard a
sound behind me resembling the growl of a dog
who is not quite sure whether he should bark or
not. I turned round, and beheld old Bentley
at my heels; and this movement had the effect
which it would have operated on one of the canine
species in giving voice to the <i>grumble</i>.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, poetry and sentiment&mdash;romance
and delusion! But yours, Mr. Howard, is the
natural age for all these humbugs. You will
come to your senses before your glass runs out,
and find that you are mistaken in your views of
happiness."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said I, "it is some comfort that
at my time of life you <i>admit</i> of my being deceived
into bliss; and as life is short, as well as precarious,
it is a great matter to be delighted even
with <i>shadows</i>. But why do you set your face, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Mr. Bentley, against nature, and insist upon
forestalling the season of care, and laying burthens
of anxiety on shoulders not fitted to the
toil of supporting them? The colt in the forest
is allowed to range at liberty till his strength is
matured, and he can bear the load that is destined
for his back. Do you really think that it
is right to anticipate evil, and never enjoy present
good?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Mr. Bentley; "but a wise
man removes the veil from his eyes as soon as
possible, and endeavours to see through the
mists of folly and prejudice which obscure his
horizon. He directs all his energies to the pole
star of truth, which will quickly place the things
of this world in their just light to his understanding,
and teach him that what is called society
is a foul cheat; a dishonest compact, by
which people agree to jockey each other, and
pass, like counterfeit coin, for the things that
they are not; assuming manners, professing regard,
and displaying dispositions the very opposite
of those that are exhibited when the mask is
taken off in the privacy of retirement. Then, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
as to sunshine, and fine scenery, let people enjoy
them for the <i>time</i> if they will, but not imagine
that a cloudless sky or perennial green
would change the heart of man and make him
contented. No, sir, independence is the only
positive good of merely earthly origin; it gives
us the power of being useful to others, and of
being disengaged from the trammels of the
world ourselves."</p>

<p>"And pray," said Mrs. Fitzroy, who leaned
on my right arm, while Emily occupied the left,
Mr. Otway and George Bentley bringing up the
rear of <i>our</i> division, "are such feelings as you
express likely to lead to your conclusion? Will
riches be employed for the relief of others who
want their aid, by a man who thinks of his fellow-creatures
as you do, and looks at creation
through a jaundiced medium?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not always with <i>intention</i>, madam,"
said old <i>Crabstick</i>; "but the beauty of money
is that it works without impulse, and <i>must</i> do
good in spite of its possessor. Even a miser,
who expends only enough to preserve life, is
hoarding that which, if useless now, will circulate <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
here-after for the benefit of mankind. And
this is an extreme case: there are few misers in
the community."</p>

<p>"I conclude then," said Mrs. Fitzroy, "that
you approve of money matches as they are called,
and would not readily forgive a son of yours
if you had one, for marrying badly, in a worldly
sense?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, madam," answered old Bentley,
with great animation, and apparently charmed
with having an opportunity in this natural manner
of giving out the whole "head and front"
of his opinion upon so important a subject,
<i>perhaps</i> with a secret view of regulating the
conduct of his nephew, "You are perfectly
right, very right indeed in your supposition,
Mrs. Fitzroy. Money matches are the <i>only
matches</i>. Money meets money, there is no deception
in that sympathy, all else is balderdash;
and except in a very few remarkable cases of
happy marriage, which like the flowers of the
aloë, bloom only once in a hundred years, you
may pick out and select with all your care the
finest ingredients of learning, taste, accomplishments, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
and so forth. I give you <i>carte blanche</i>
in your choice, but bring them together at the
altar, and in a year you will have a dish of <i>sour
crout</i> as the result of your compound."</p>

<p>"How <i>can</i> you hold such opinions of your
fellow-creatures, Mr. Bentley? It is surely
you yourself that convert all mankind into
acids, by looking on them. I should be afraid
if you walked into my dairy, that the very milk-pans
would turn to curds and whey on your
entrance," answered Mrs. Fitzroy; "but were
the fact really as you describe, I should like, for
the sake of curiosity, to hear how you account
for this transmuting effect of marriage on the
human mind?"</p>

<p>"Why, madam, in various ways. In the
principal number of instances, no transmutation
at all takes place; the only difference is,
that people discover each other's true characters
when it is too late to remedy their want of accordance,
and then it is much worse to find
yourself ill yoked in marriage, than suffering
disagreement in any other relation of life. If
children live unhappily with parents, there are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
all the chances of death, matrimony, and profession,
for separating the discordant elements.
If brothers and sisters quarrel, <i>they</i> too are free
to hope at least for better days; and in both
these cases the evil in question is not of a man's
own contriving. No one feels lessened in his
own eyes, however he may be otherwise vexed,
if he loses at a game of hazard; but marriage
is like chess, if we are <i>check-mated</i> there, it is
our own fault, and proves our want of penetration.
This, madam, is a grand cause of unhappiness
in married life. People cannot forgive
themselves for having sacrificed their liberties,
and committed <i>felo de se</i> on their own peace. If
you are not satisfied with the causes already
given, of disunion in this generally luckless
bond, I can supply you with fresh impediments
to contentment, without going out of my way
in search of them. I see people every day
whose wits are all laid up in ordinary, like ships
of war after a battle, which, when once the
conflict is over, are dismantled, and left to their
fate. Intellect, madam, which you ladies of the
<i>Blue school</i> make such a fuss about, is a pretty <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
toy in the hands and heads of single folk, who
turn it to account for pleasure or profit; but in
married life, it is not wanted. People who are
buckled together, probably know each other's
sentiments upon most subjects; and no one would
ever be at the trouble of talking upon abstract
matters, if the vanity of display, the pride of
triumph and the stimulus of novelty, were put
out of the question. The world of <i>fashion</i> is
not troubled with brains in either <i>one</i> condition
or the <i>other</i>; and as for your Darbys and Joans,
it is far better for them to nod at each other in
a couple of arm-chairs in the chimney corner,
than debate about morals, manners, or 'the
Punic war.' Madam, man is <i>sui generis</i>, a
pugnacious dogged animal, and requires all the
restraints which public opinion imposes, to prevent
him from being rude and overbearing.
Amongst strangers he <i>must</i> not be so, or if he
give way, and outstep the bounds of propriety,
he is sure to get a timely rap over the knuckles,
which calls him to order; but in his own family
he is generally a bear without its muzzle on, and
depend upon it, the less <i>argument</i> the better between <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the sexes, when once they are noosed in
the holy bands. They have enough to do to get
through the daily affairs of life, without fighting
in earnest upon practical subjects; and are foolish
if they throw away time in idle skirmishing
on theoretical topics. What signifies it to any
man, or woman either, whether Newton's <i>Principia</i>
be founded, or not, in true philosophy;
whether Lock's Essay on the Human Understanding
be or be not unanswerable; whether
air and water are simples or compounds;
whether the earths can be turned into metals,
and diamonds be reducible, so as to leave no
residuum behind in the crucible. Such points
are very useful and interesting to mathematicians,
professors of moral philosophy and chemists,
but what have lawyers, physicians, officers in the
army and navy, merchants, and country gentlemen,
to do with these matters at their fire-sides?
No, madam, people must, that is, the <i>major part</i>
of mankind, must marry, for so it is ordained.
The earth must be replenished, and marriage is
the nursery to furnish a succession of young
plants, as the old ones die down, and return to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
their dust; but <i>wise</i> people (I grant you that
they are few in number), purchase exemption
from many of the thorns and vexations of life
by the union of well-lined purses. Prudent
parents, by insisting on good settlements and
suitable <i>pin-money</i> (as a separate income
is foolishly called), may secure their daughters
against the tyranny of present power, and
future extravagance; while a man who marries
a good fortune, is enabled to relieve both himself
and his wife from the <i>tedium vitæ</i> of each
other's society, by keeping a hospitable table at
which cheerful company may beguile the monotony
of domestic routine."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzroy smiled, and said, "Well, at least
you are candid enough to throw the principal
odium on the male part of creation, and I
believe that many women would heartily thank
you for the establishment of liberal <i>pin</i> money,
which, according to your account, is very <i>aptly</i>
named I think, as it is the only arrangement
you say, that attaches the parties to each other,
and prevents perpetual flying off?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, in ninety-nine cases out of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
every hundred, money is at the <i>bottom</i> of domestic
strife. Some women are fools and lavish,
others are cunning and narrow-minded; but,
almost <i>all</i> men are devoted to the <i>love of power</i>,
and hate to share the dominion over their
coffers. It may perhaps surprise you to hear
what I am going to say, coming from the lips of
a rough mortal like myself, but I will confess
that I have never known any thing approaching
to happiness or respectability in married life
where, if the woman did not manage all the
pecuniary concerns of the family, she had not at
least an equal share in them. I have a tolerably
bad opinion, generally speaking, of <i>both</i> sexes,
but of the <i>two</i>, I think yours better than my
own. Lord Chesterfield, who saw human
nature in its true colours, though he abuses
men and women without <i>parsimony</i>, still
allots something of a better character, because
a less selfish one to the ladies, when in his
division of mankind, he asserts that "the
former are compounded of vanity and avarice;
the latter of vanity and love.'"</p>

<p>"I hate these cynics," said Mrs. Fitzroy; "and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
as to <i>you</i>, Mr. Bentley, I feel certain, that some
early disappointment in life might tell its tale,
and account for your cross-grained notions of
the world. Let me hear what Mr. Otway says
on this subject."</p>

<p>"My opinions," said the amiable Lord of
Lisfarne, so far agree with those of my worthy
friend, that I feel the imperfection of my <i>species</i>,
and have only to turn my thoughts inward to
perceive the depravity and weakness of the
human heart. Yet in this motley world there
is <i>much</i> enjoyment, <i>much</i> rational happiness, if
we use with moderation the materials which
Providence has bountifully placed within our
reach. The fact is, that this scene is <i>too</i> alluring
with all its errors and misfortunes; and a
far greater share of good might be achieved if
we did not mar our own happiness. It has
been my lot to see the finest endowments of
human character united in the bonds of wedded
affection, and I have lived to see such perfect
harmony in married life, that I can never
charge the preponderance of misery that we
daily witness to the state <i>itself</i>. On the contrary, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
were people to employ only as much attention
in this most important act of life, as they do in
any ordinary traffic, we should not have to deplore
the shipwreck of domestic happiness in
ninety-nine instances out of every hundred: but
I am far from thinking that it requires to be
highly gifted to be happy. If the capacity
of one vessel be as a pint, that of another as
a gallon, and a third as a hogshead, all may
be <i>full</i>, and none can be <i>more</i> than full. I am
of opinion, too, that very unequal measures of
intellect may meet both profitably and agreeably
in connubial life, though there can be no
doubt of the superior charms of such companionship
as that to which I first alluded;
but it is a singular coincidence, that I should at
this moment have a letter in my pocket from a
relation of my own, precisely apposite to our
present argument, which, if you like, I will read
to you."</p>

<p>We had just requested to hear the story,
when Frederick came running out of breath, to
summon us all to the beach where the nets were
drawing. We immediately started up, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
hurrying towards the shore, adjourned our debate
till after dinner, when <i>Phil.</i> engaged to
fulfil his promise. Assembled on the edge of
the lake, we saw several of the finest salmon I
ever beheld, brought to land, and M'Carty
More having secured two of the largest, for
which he made the bargain himself, he proposed
that we should proceed to Dinas Island, where
the fish was to be roasted after the manner in
which the people here are accustomed to dress
it. As we were preparing to go on board the
boat, Frederick whispered to me a remark that
M'Carty had made, in his untutored phrase,
upon Bentley the elder, and Mr. Otway, as he
saw them walking forward together.</p>

<p>"There goes a pair that were never made to
walk abreast."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" said Fred.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, that straight and crooked, bitter
and sweet, short and long, are fitter for-harness
than those two men."</p>

<p>"Describe them M'Carty," answered Fred.
"I will then," replied the boatman. "Mr.
Otway is just what a <i>raeal</i> gentlemen ought to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
be, neither too rough nor too smooth. He
knows his <i>distance</i> (meaning, I conclude, his
station), and never mounts above it, nor falls
below it; he is mild and good like a child,
though a <i>raisonable</i> man, that has a why for
every wherefore; but Mr. Bentley, Sir, never
got out of bed in his life, that it was'nt with the
left foot foremost, and so every thing goes contrary
with him."</p>

<p>How admirable are these rough sketches by
ignorant beings of the lowest class! Oh the
exquisite beauty of Dinas! but I have made a
vow not to entangle you in bowers, nor plunge
you in the silver stream. This island is flat,
and of much greater extent than Innisfallen;
there is a pretty cottage upon it, where preparations
were made for our repast by those
amphibious animals who live indifferently on
land and water, and who were suddenly metamorphosed
into cooks, having previously performed
the parts of rowers, and next of fishermen.
They instantly split the salmon, and
having cut some stakes of arbutus, <i>spitted</i> the
fish, and fixed it in the ground, then lighting a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
fire all round, completed the operation with
culinary skill, and served up, in process of
time, the best dish of fish that I have tasted.
This mode of cooking has a peculiar name, and
a salmon dressed in the manner that I have
mentioned, is said to be <i>kibbobed</i>, the term, as
Mr. Oliphant informed us, applied to a favourite
food in Persia, which is made by splitting
and broiling fowls, as the fish was managed
here, and in the method to which we gave the
name of <i>spatchcock</i>&mdash;another coincidence between
that country and the Island of Saints.
When we had finished our rural banquet, and
again <i>filed off into</i> detachments, I found myself
pursuing a beautiful pathway among the trees,
along the border of the Lake, arm-in-arm with
Mr. Otway; and, when we had interchanged
some remarks on the loveliness of the surrounding
scenery, I begged him to give me a key to
some of the characters that composed our party.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bentley is a very amusing person to
me," said I, "and his <i>running bass</i> of <i>ill</i>
humour so <i>good</i> humouredly expressed, forms an
anomaly in his manner exceedingly diverting. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Mrs. Fitzroy too is very agreeable, and the continual
skirmishing sustained with so much spirit
on her side, between that lady and Mr. Bentley,
is fully as pleasant as "Mathews at
Home;" but I am not enough acquainted to
understand her completely, and, as for young
Bentley, though I <i>like</i> him much, and <i>esteem</i>
him more, I am not familiar with his <i>style</i>, and
wish, of all things, for some light into his history."</p>

<p>"You have set me a task," answered Mr.
Otway, "which would require more time to execute
than we have at present to spare; but you
are perfectly right in your conjecture, that they
are all three worth knowing <i>au fond</i> as characters
of peculiar though very different construction;
and I look upon every one of them as
such a well defined specimen of its genus, that
were I assorting mankind, as a cutler does knives
and scissors, I would stick my three friends on
the outside of my parcels, as indexes to the
contents within each paper of the several classes
to which they belong. Though the lady claims
precedence, I will tell you something of my old <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
neighbour to begin with:&mdash;Mrs. Fitzroy made
a true hit to-day, when she said that she was
certain he had been disappointed in early life.
It was exactly the case. He began the world
with humble expectations, and was intended for
the profession of an attorney. Nature had
given him a strong and shrewd understanding,
set in one of those brazen scabbards that defy
the inroads of time and bad weather. He was
one of many children, and accustomed, as the
sailors say, to <i>roughing it</i>, through life. With a
body in which <i>nerves</i> were left out, and a mind
divested of any troublesome sensibilities, he
<i>tackled</i> to his calling, and had not fortune stepped
in between him and the necessity of working
for his bread, would not only have been one of
the most active of the busy fraternity with which
he was incorporated, but would also, I believe,
have set a praiseworthy example of upright conduct;
for I look upon him as a man of incorruptible
integrity. He had finished his <i>noviciate</i>,
and was just embarking in this minor department
of the law, with a respectable coadjutor,
when he began to think that a partner of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the softer sex might be a proper <i>coping to the
wall</i> of his destiny; and accordingly he made
his proposals to a young lady of some personal
attraction, and such a convenient <i>modicum</i> of
wealth as, without rendering it presumptuous to
approach her, flattered his self-complacency
with the prospect of meriting, at least, an <i>ovation</i>
for his success. There was no <i>if</i> in the
calculation; a doubt never once insinuated itself
into his mind; not that he was a conceited or
overbearing young man by any means; but his
opinions, derived from vulgar sources, were
made up in bundles, endorsed, and stowed away
in the various compartments of his pericranium,
where they were alphabetically arranged like
papers in the pigeon-holes of his desk. On
looking at number thirteen, letter M, and taking
down the packet, he found it docketed 'Marriage;'
and on turning a page, the following
synopsis of contents may, we suppose, have presented
itself to his view:&mdash;'Eight and twenty;
fair time to look for a wife&mdash;marriage, convenient
for man&mdash;indispensable for woman&mdash;idle
to marry without money&mdash;a profession, may <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
reasonably be reckoned against three or four
thousand pounds. Any thing over five feet
eight <i>tells</i> in the appearance of a man; figure of
more consequence than face, with a man <i>on his
preferment</i> as touching the other sex.' It was
not needful to seek farther into the documents
thus labelled. My worthy friend, perhaps,
heaved a natural sigh, as he involuntarily approached
his faithful mirror for the purpose of
smartening his dress, and read the mortifying
sentence of 'hard featured,' which, added to
the painful certainty that he wanted two inches
of standard measure, might have damped the
energies of our would-be Benedick, had it not
been that some unseen but friendly spirit so frequently
takes compassion on our humiliation,
and whispers comfort in extremity. Such consolatory
unction was poured into Bentley's
bosom in this trying moment. If his optics
rested on a snub nose, ferret eyes, and pock-marked
cheeks, his good genius breathed into
his ear the words 'quick, intelligent, droll;' and
when the fidelity of a two-foot rule forced the
unwelcome conviction of five feet six as the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
utmost height to which truth would permit him
to aspire, the soothing sounds of 'well-built,
compact, genteel,' again fell on his organ of
hearing, as if sent from Heaven to encourage
his faultering purpose. The toilette ended,
Bentley took his well brushed hat, and catching
up a slight rattan, which not only gave a finish
to that <i>dapper</i> activity on which he meant to
rest the character of his appearance, to which
<i>grace</i> was unfortunately denied, but was likewise
useful in supplying an object <i>with</i> which to
twirl away an awkward feeling, should such
arise, our hero set out, and walked towards
Surgeon Sharp's, with an expression in his gait
which, if called upon to translate, you would
have interpreted by the words, 'secure, confiding,
and self-satisfied.' Alas! what vicissitudes
are incident to our mortal career!</p>

<p>"Bentley returned to number one, Mortgage
Row, had a rapid vision of his chop-fallen
countenance in the large brass plate upon which
was engraved 'Deeds, Bentley and Co.;' rushed
to his apartment, exchanged his black stock for
an easier neck-cloth, and, whistling louder than <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
he had ever been known to do before, took four
steps in every stride down stairs, and joined his
partner, a keen, sarcastic, but sensible man,
from whom I had the greater part of these particulars,
at dinner. But, as every man has his
evil, as well as his friendly genius, rumour has
spread to the winds that poor Bentley's thoughts
being unpleasantly occupied, he wished to drown
them, and swallowing a more liberal potation
than was his ordinary custom, of native spirit,
diluted with warm water, and seasoned with
lemon and sugar, experience confirmed the proverb
of '<i>in vino veritas</i>,' the half-muttered
sounds of 'rejected addresses,' and stimulated the
curiosity of Mr. Jacob Deeds. The distressing
confession distilled from Bentley's lips, and so
entirely did he lose all prudent controul over
his feelings, that the boy who passed to and fro
with the dinner apparatus, heard sufficient of
his misadventure to make a good foundation,
and splicing on from his own invention as much
as was requisite to complete the story, he published
his master's disgrace with the diligence of
a bell-man that evening. When Bentley went <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
to court on the following day, he was attacked
on all sides, and to come to the <i>moral</i> of my
tale, this <i>debut</i> in <i>love affairs</i> gave the bias
which has influenced the life and character of
my honest neighbour from seven and twenty to
sixty years of age. Had <i>affection</i> been blighted,
I could not even <i>now</i> laugh at his expense, but
his pride alone was engaged. The prudential
aphorisms which he had learned of vulgar
parents, had established certain points as fixed
principles in his mind, not requiring farther
discussion. Amongst these, was the firm belief
that no young woman could possibly refuse a
tolerable match, and <i>partiality</i> having, perhaps,
represented the offer of his own hand as something
<i>beyond</i> the average of good luck in the
case of Miss Sharp, it was too much for his
philosophy to find such a flaw in a theory which
might have otherwise lasted to the end of his
days, and not only this vexation in the abstract,
but the particular sting of furnishing the contradiction
in his own person. He began with
rage, and finding no balsam in his wrath, he
turned on mankind, and revenged, by the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
poignancy of his satire against the whole species,
this fancied wrong inflicted by a single individual.
In a short time after, an advertisement
appeared in the papers, setting forth the death
of a person who possessed considerable property,
and who dying intestate, and without any near
relations, the next of kin were called upon to
declare themselves. At the end of a suit which
occupied four or five years, my friend's claim
was substantiated, and he was put in peaceable
possession. The progress of time, which mellows
men and wine, together with the healing
which affluence brought to his pride, operated
a salutary change, not in kind but degree.
His mind had received a bent which no after
circumstances of his life had power to alter, but
every year has produced a softening effect, and
he is now, comparatively, smooth as oil. George,
who is the only son of a brother, who died a
few years ago, will probably inherit his uncle's
estate, if he can submit to the penalty of being
guided solely by his advice. Of this I doubt,
and, as I have a great regard for the young
man, I cannot help watching him with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
anxiety."</p>

<p>I delight so much in Mr. Otway, that I
treasure all he says, and have given you his
account of old Bentley as nearly as possible, in
his own words; but just as I pressed him to tell
me all that he knew of the nephew, we were
joined by some stragglers of our party, amongst
whom was Bentley himself. The weather was
enchanting, the Lake dotted with boats, and we
perceived that our island was not sacred to us.
As we proceeded to explore the intricacies
which thickets of the finest evergreens concealed
from our view, several voices assailed us at once;
we saw a number of gay-looking people land
from a barge at a little distance; feathers waved
in the air, peals of laughter were driven by the
breeze, and we would gladly have retired, but
a sort of rude curiosity, common to fashionable
people, impelled the strangers to overtake and
see <i>what we were like.</i> Conceive my astonishment
on hearing my name pronounced, and, in
a moment, finding myself in the midst of a
group composed of Lady Matilda Murray, her
pretty daughters, her son Henry, Lord John <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Craven, young Lewellyn Spencer, and half a
score others, with whom I was slightly, or not
at all acquainted, and who might have been
mistaken for figures hired from a hair dresser's
shop window to swell Lady Matilda's train, if
it had not been for the uproar that they made.
Conscious, long ago, of the revolution which
has taken place in my mind, I never knew its
full extent till this meeting. Nay, I have often
felt at intervals that opportunity might again
betray me into my former participation in all
the follies which used to occupy without interesting
me; but Dinas island has finished my
conversion. The place seemed absolutely profaned
by the presence of this silly group of milliners'
dolls, and hair-dressers' dandies. It was
so incongruous a sight, that, forgetting how
lately I had been one of themselves; that I too
had lived in London's west end, and that steam
packets and post horses had not ceased to be
when <i>I</i> was deposited in the County of Kerry,
I wondered like an idiot how they came to Killarney;
and I believe looked as the savage of
Averon might have done, had he suddenly met <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the <i>beau monde</i> of Versailles in his forest. The
whole set gathered round me at once, and, totally
regardless of the company to which I was
attached, they overwhelmed me with questions
all talking together. Even Miss Murray, whom
we used to call the "sleeping beauty," seemed
inspired with animation, and became as obstreperous
as her sister. When the din had in
some degree subsided, Lady Matilda, in a languid
drawl, said, "I assure you, Mr. Howard,
you should not waste time in these wilds. Reports
are in circulation respecting some members
of your family; and delays are dangerous. The
prize may slip out of your sister's fingers if you
are tardy. I speak as a true friend, I do assure
you." "Aye, aye," added her ass of a son,
who was standing close to us, "bag the game
Howard as fast as you can, or i' faith it may
fly and leave you in the lurch."&mdash;Before I had
time to utter a syllable in reply to these impertinencies,
Miss Angelina Murray abruptly exclaimed,
"oh! but would it not be excellent if
Mr. Howard were to give us a sermon <i>al fresco</i>.
All the world is of opinion that he has turned <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Methodist, and it would be charming to tell of
this adventure when we go back. Do dear Mr.
Howard, you may make it as short as ever you
please; but <i>do</i> indulge us with a discourse.
Here I will send Lord John for my cloak; you
shall put it on, and fancy it a full suit of canonicals.
Pray do not disappoint your congregation."</p>

<p>This wit, which appeared to be considered
quite attic, was received with bursts of laughter,
which intoxicating its vapid author, she would
have gone on plaguing me with her nonsense
till now, if I had not cleared my throat, and,
like a canary bird, conquered every other voice
by the vociferation of my own. At length I
was heard, and succeeded in telling Lady Matilda
that I had come like herself to see Killarney;
that like her too I intended returning to
town, and if arrived there before her Ladyship,
should be happy to execute her commands.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said she, "I shall return myself
as fast as my delicate health will permit, and
shall be happy to take you back in my suite.
You seem to have got into a set of odd-looking <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
people here. <i>Natives</i>, I conclude; and the
sooner you leave them the better. As to me, I
never was so weary in my life; and am so
frightened too, since I came into this barbarous
country, that I do not attempt to sleep, though
I make two of the servants sit up every night
with loaded arms to repel an attack. It is more
than my nerves can endure; and I fear that I
have already suffered in a greater degree than I
am aware of."</p>

<p>"Are you not pleased with this scenery," said
I, "Lady Matilda?" turning a deaf ear to absurdities
which I could not answer: "Killarney
is the only place with which, after hearing such
encomiums as all people of taste lavish upon its
exquisite beauty, I have not been disappointed;
and the lower Lake is nothing, I am told, in
comparison of what we have to see." "<i>I</i> shall
see no more, I promise you," replied <i>Miladi</i>;
"I have had enough of this sort of thing. The air
is too damp&mdash;it disagrees with me; and besides,
the object is achieved. <i>We have been at Killarney</i>,
and may pass our travelling examination.
This sort of thing is vastly tiresome, and too <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
fatiguing for my nerves. Then '<i>le jeu ne vaut
pas la chandelle</i>, "I dread the Trosach, but I
suppose that we must make a tour in Scotland,
Lord John is so bent upon it; and really three
days more in this horrible place would kill me."</p>

<p>Joyful to my ear were the sounds of parting;
and having extricated myself, I scarcely know
how, from this "unreal mockery," I took my
leave, with a promise to call upon her Ladyship,
and, bidding adieu to the rest of her <i>Court</i>, I
bounded over every obstacle of rock or brush-wood,
that separated me from my own party,
and never felt the triumph of nature and good
sense to be so complete as when I regained their
society, and listened once more to their refreshing
conversation. We were not molested any
farther. I saw some of Lady Matilda's attendant
swains yawn and stretch their arms, as I
passed them by; and it was not long before we
discovered them re-embarked, with cloaks spread
across their knees, as a substitute for tables, and
engaged in two regular matches at cards, while
their boat returned towards Ross' Castle.</p>

<p><i>We</i> lingered untired till the moon rose upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the water, and never will the impression of that
evening be erased from my imagination. We
rowed round Dinas, we coasted Glena, and
again took a view of Innisfallen wrapped in
shadows. We had two bugles on board, and
were so fortunate as to secure a man of the
name of Spillane, who is a capital performer,
for our principal musician. Nothing could be
more rapturous than the sensations I experienced
when M'Carty, whose fine athletic form, as
he sweeps the oar, is worthy of the canvass, called
to Spillane and his brother bugler, saying,
"Come, my hearties, the oars are flagging&mdash;blast
up a tune that will make the boat walk of
herself." No sooner had the word been given,
than the inspiring air of Stuart memory, called
"Who'll be King but Charley?" was admirably
played. The effect was magical. The sinews
that had been flaccid before, from heat and toil,
seemed braced afresh. The men were silent&mdash;sat
erect&mdash;and appeared endowed with new
powers. No longer a set of slouching boors,
mumbling each his quid of tobacco, which the
peasants here chew as the Turks do opium <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
or beetle nut, our boatmen rose in dignity as
they yielded to the talismanic influence of a
strain replete with the expression of spirit and
pathos, that <i>rainbow</i> character of music, so
deeply interesting, and of which the Irish are so
sensible, that it seems to speak directly to their
hearts, in a language all their own. The boat
really <i>did</i> appear, as M'Carty said, "to walk of
herself" over the Lake, so long, so smooth, so
vigorous, was the pull, and such perfect time
did the rowers observe; but Spillane's power of
enchantment was not confined to them. The
whole band partook of the emotion which he
excited. My dear aunt turned her face towards
the dark wooded side of Glena, and rivers of
gentle tears were silently mingled with the
waves below. Mrs. Fitzroy stood up, fired, as
she afterwards said, with such enthusiasm, that,
like Semiramis of antient memory, she could in
that moment have placed herself at the head of
a warlike host, and led them on to death or victory.
She absolutely looked pale with the intenseness
of sublime sensation. Russell was, as
usual, in a state of convulsion; and all were <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
silent, till, actuated by an impulse compounded
of all the varied sensibilities of those around me,
I gave utterance to a passing wish that I was
Charles-Edward. "And <i>I</i> Flora M'Donald!"
exclaimed dear little Fanny; who seemed delighted
at having her tongue untied, and finding
a precedent in my rapture for expressing
her own&mdash;but without the most distant idea of
paying me a compliment, by coupling her destiny
with mine. <i>Her</i> wish had, in fact, been
formed without reference to me; and, had I
said anything else than what I did say, it would
have equally unlocked Fanny's lips, who longed
to speak, but who was withheld by a native modesty,
which is inseparable even from her moments
of greatest excitement, from being the
<i>first</i> to do so. It was <i>her</i> turn now to govern
our sympathies. She had touched a new spring,
and many a gay smile shone through the tears
that had been flowing. Many a merry peal of
hearty laughter brought us again into cheerful
communion. "Miss Fanny Douglas," said Russell,
"I envy Howard, who has received so explicit
a declaration of your kind feelings towards <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
him." Fanny looked <i>blank</i> for a second or two
before she caught his meaning, so <i>single</i> had
been the thought that occupied her mind when
she spoke&mdash;but seizing on the new idea presented,
she blushed violently, <i>only</i> because it <i>was</i>
new; and with that exquisite <i>naïveté</i> which is
worth all the treasures of Golconda, she hastily
answered, "Indeed, no: I did not think of any
one except my favourite Pretender alone; but
that makes little difference, for my cousin knows
perfectly well that whatever Flora could accomplish
for Charles-Edward I should desire to perform
for Arthur, if he stood in need of my
assistance."</p>

<p>I must now hurry you to the landing-place,
transport you from thence to the inn, dispatch
supper, and distribute the group into their several
apartments. Russell contrived, as I squeezed
into mine, which is hardly large enough to turn
about in, to impart his secret to the faithful
<i>porches</i> of mine ear; and I have it now from his
own confession, that he is in the list of <i>killed
and wounded</i>. I asked whether he had any reason
to expect reciprocity of disposition, but he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
said no. "I <i>hope,</i> but I certainly have no reason
to <i>expect</i>. These charming Douglasses love
each other so much that it is very difficult to
penetrate their sentiments towards strangers.
Girls in general think little of mothers, except
as necessary appendages. A <i>chaperone</i> is indispensable,
and therefore young ladies tolerate
their mammas in that character; but these cousins
of yours seem to idolize their parent, and to
be almost absorbed in studying her countenance,
and reading every thought as it arises in her
soul." Annesley's entrance interrupted our dialogue,
which ended for the present; and the
next morning saw us gliding over the calm expanse
which we had traversed the day before, to
visit a new region, of such perfection as, if I had
not forsworn all description, would puzzle me to
find words in which to clothe it. Traits and
touches&mdash;mere memoranda&mdash;are all that I
shall give you. Of the first, I must relate one
which is worthy of your moral sketch-book.
There is a narrow strait, of exquisite beauty,
dividing the upper from the lower lake, which,
from the shelving nature of the ground, assumes <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
somewhat the appearance of a rapid. At this
place it is customary for the boatmen to quit
their boats, which are dragged up by main force
to a joyous cry, which they raise in concert, as
American sailors do in heaving the anchor. It
is a particularly cheerful sound, and pleasing
from the measured cadence in which it is given.
While the boatmen, who strip off their shoes
and stockings, jump into the water, and ranging
themselves two and two, perform this feat,
the company are always landed, and pursue a
winding path on the verge of the water, till the
boat is drawn into the lake above, and they are
ushered into that aquatic paradise.</p>

<p>On the night preceding this day, a poor fellow
had reached this narrow pass from the
upper country in a tiny skiff. A sudden gust,
which frequently occurs in this amphitheatre of
mountains, hurried him so irresistibly down the
watery descent that his little bark was overset,
and no human being living near the spot, his
voice was not heard;&mdash;unable to swim, he was
drowned, and his lifeless corse was extricated in
the morning from a bed of arbutus, which lay <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
so softly on the surface of the lake that it appeared
more like a Naiad's couch than the bier
of poor Florence O'Neil. Our men were none
of them related to him. They only knew who
he was, and that he was unfortunate. When
we reached this little gorge, we were told to prepare
for landing, and M'Carty More standing
up in the boat, poising his oar with graceful ease,
and making no more of its weight than if it had
been a straw, addressed himself to us all, and
said, "Ladies and Gentlemen, I hope that your
honours will not take it amiss if we draw up the
boat silent and quiet, like the poor fellow himself
that lay here this morning." So saying, he
and his comrades, without uttering a sound,
pulled our bark forward in the profoundest stillness;
thus paying a tribute of delicate feeling to
the manes of a departed brother, which would
have adorned a far higher class in life. We
were all affected by this incident, which was
quickly changed from a merely sentimental occurrence
into one of practical compassion and
usefulness, by a proposal from my aunt, that the
same spot which had in the former moment <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
been dedicated to remembrance of the dead,
should now be marked by tender care for the
living. "Here is my subscription," said she,
"and when we have made up a little sum for
the widow and orphans of poor Florence,
M'Carty More, if you please, shall have the
pleasure of bestowing it." Joy lit up the countenances
which had been just before honestly
expressive of sadness, and showers of choicest
blessings were lavished on the mover of this
benevolent project. M'Carty's thanks were as
warm, as if he had been made rich himself; and
when Russell good humouredly said to him, "I
suppose that you are flattered, by being chosen
to convey glad tidings to the poor woman and
her children, and pleased that Mrs. Douglas
should put such confidence in you;" his noble
reply was, "No your honour. The lady would
not have mistrusted <i>any</i> of us; we may all be
bad enough, but there is not a man in the boat,
I'll be bound to say, would rob the widow.
Every one of these lads, sir, gave half a crown
this morning to bury poor O'Neil, and while
they had a potato themselves they would not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
<i>begrudge</i> the half of it to her that's left desolate."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzroy gave a searching look, and
shook her head at old Bentley, who growled
under his breath, but for <i>once</i> did not express
his scepticism in words. We now entered the
upper lake, and all language fails to do justice
here.</p>

<p>Do you remember the happy valley of Abyssinia,
described in Rasselas? Here is in water
what that was in land. So completely are you
surrounded with the magnificent range of mountains
which inclose this little world of beauty,
that you seem as if separated at once from all
that is external to it. You perceive no means
of either egress or ingress, and but for the recollection
of having entered by that narrow pass
which I have described, might fancy yourself let
down from the skies. This lake is sprinkled
over thickly with islands, every one of which
would make a picture in itself. These are covered
with the most luxuriant evergreens, the
glossy brightness of which might warrant a belief
(were fairies as efficient personages as in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
"olden time") that they had been under water
till your approach, and rose at that moment into
air, "dripping odours" in all the freshness of a
new creation. While we gazed in astonishment
at the scene before us, silence again took up her
sceptre, and no one appeared willing to disturb
her reign.</p>

<p>I cannot with accuracy describe any feelings
save my own, though I think I could read several
minds amid the group; but for myself, I felt
actually raised above this nether sphere, and as
if I was holding communion with Deity, in this
the first hour of my life in which I beheld his
perfect workmanship, unspoiled by the finger of
man. I was in a <i>trance</i>, and should have lost
every remembrance that human creatures surrounded
me, had not M'Carty More, in a half
whisper directed to Frederick, who wins every
heart which was not already his own, interrupted
my musings by saying, "Mr. Douglas, I come
from the rightful kings of this place, and though
I am a poor man now, I can make <i>you</i> king, sir,
of one of these <i>islands</i>, and, with the help o'God,
you <i>shall</i> be king of it sure enough: pull my <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
hearties for M'Carty More's Island."</p>

<p>We were awakened from our reverie. The
tear drops were brushed from aunt Douglas's
eye. Mrs. Fitzroy's cheek, which blanches with
emotion, resumed its colour. Emily and Charlotte,
whose countenances are the most pelucid,
mirrors of all that passes within, were illuminated
by Frederick's approaching triumph, and
Fanny's ready joy sparkled so brightly in her
eyes, as, in a poet's fancy at least, to make the
rippling of the lake, while our bark shot nimbly
through its gentle bosom, shine with more dancing
radiance than the sun alone could have imparted.
Now followed a scene of mock heroic,
amusing from the gravity with which it was conducted,
and curious from the mixture of knowledge
and ignorance, of law and fiction, which
it involved. We were marshalled by M'Carty
in a circle, on this beautiful <i>spangle</i> of earth,
the sovereignty of which was to be bestowed
upon our youthful chief. Frederick was placed
in the midst; a sod was cut from the turf, and
an arbutus twig severed from the shrubs which
hung over our heads. With these insignia of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
feudal investiture, M'Carty approached the
monarch who was to be, and kneeling on one
knee presented <i>seizin</i> of his dominions, with an
appropriate enumeration in correct Latin, of the
rights and royalties intended to be conveyed by
this Imperial grant, the boatmen forming a
semicircle exterior to the ring already mentioned.
When Frederick received the symbols of his
enfeoffment with a graceful bow, a shout from
the men proclaimed the act of acceptance; and
next followed the anointing, which was <i>here</i> performed
with "mountain dew," alias whiskey,
which I suspect M'Carty and his fellows prefer
on such occasions to oil. Two or three bottles
of this Irish usquebaugh were brought from the
boat, one of them was dashed upon a rock, and
the name of "Frederick's Island," pronounced
by M'Carty, who enacted the part of high-priest.
The next step was to quaff a libation
to the honour of the new monarch, in
which part of the ceremony he was obliged to
join; and after drinking to the health and
happiness of the crew, Fred. was installed,
desired to take his seat on the rude throne <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
prepared by spirituous unction for his accommodation,
and to exercise his first act of authority,
in arresting the arm of Russell, who was busily
employed in cutting a fine walking-stick of arbutus.</p>

<p>The party were again seated in their boat,
when old Bentley repaid Mrs. Fitzroy's piercing
look, of which I told you, <i>in kind</i>, and with his
<i>grimmest</i> expression of discontent, turned to her,
with, "<i>There</i> madam! <i>There</i> are cunning rascals
for you! Those scoundrels will elect a king
from every boat-load of blockheads that they
bring to the upper lake during the season, and
will wheedle money out of the <i>royal</i> pocket, and
guzzle whiskey at the general cost, till they have
not an eye left in their heads." How Mrs. Fitzroy
would have turned the edge of old Bentley's
ire if she had been disengaged, I cannot tell,
but she was listening with so much interest to
Domine, that Bentley's tirade passed over her
mind, and seemed to be shaken from it like
"dew drops from the lion's mane," while she
gave her attention to Mr. Oliphant, who is really
a mine of knowledge, and who possesses the art <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
of rendering it always pleasing, by his unaffected
simple manner, the accuracy of his information,
and the tact with which he imparts it.</p>

<p>The <i>investiture</i> which we had just witnessed,
called forth an agreeable and instructive account
of consecration in all its varieties of mode, from
the field of Luz mentioned in the 28th chapter
of Genesis, to the stone alluded to in the
Odyssey, on which Neleus sat "equal in counsel
to the Gods." Pope, I remember, translated
this passage in four lines, which I gave to Mrs.
Fitzroy, in pencil on a scrap of paper, as Domine
paused on his tide of learned lore:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">
<div class="line">"The old man early rose, walk'd forth and sat</div>
<div class="line">On polished stone, before his palace gate;</div>
<div class="line">With unguent smooth, the lucid marble shone,</div>
<div class="line">Where ancient Neleus sat, a rustic throne."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>From thence Mr. Oliphant adverted to the
superstitious accounts of the Baithylia, or consecrated
stones of Phoenicia mentioned in <i>Sanchoniatho</i>,
and a great deal more very pleasantly
communicated, which you shall have in my journal,
but not <i>here</i>. I must, however, give you
the history of the stone which you and I looked <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
at not long ago, in Westminster Abbey. It
lies, you may recollect, under the old chair on
which the Kings of England are crowned in the
Chapel of Edward the First, and a Scotchman
who was standing by when you and I were there
took the whole credit of this sacred relique to
himself, declaring that it was originally a supernatural
gift to his country, and had a prophecy
attached to it of the highest importance to the
Caledonians. It was called "<i>Ni fallit Fatum</i>,"
and gave rise to the verses which are translated
into English thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">
<div class="line">"Or Fate's deceived, or Heaven decrees in vain,</div>
<div class="line">Or where they find this stone the Scots shall reign."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But it seems that this precious morsel of antiquity,
said to be the pillow of Jacob, on which
he laid his head, when he slept on the plain of
Luz, and dreamed of the ladder that reached
to the skies, was really wrested from Ireland
(whither it had travelled from its original site,
first to Jerusalem, from thence into Spain, and
thence again into this country, where it lay
treasured as it deserved to be, in the great Cathedral <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
on the rock of Cashel) by Fergus the
First of Scotland, who conveyed it to Scone,
and on it the Scottish Kings were always
placed to be crowned, till Edward the First
transported this "Patriarchal bolster" to Westminster,
where it is still preserved with veneration,
not unmixed perhaps with a certain dread
of seeing the dynasty pass away, should the stone
set out again upon a <i>tour</i>, as the marriage of
Margaret of Scotland into the Royal Family of
England, gave colour to the fidelity of that prophecy
to which I have alluded, when this bone
of contention quitted its Northern abode.</p>

<p>If Domine had not soon come to the end of
his story, we should probably have been out
all night in the lakes, for so intense was the
curiosity of M'Carty and his myrmidons to devour
every syllable of the tale, that they lay
upon their oars, and appeared in danger of being
metamorphosed into images of stone themselves,
such fixed attention did they bestow upon
a legend which I am certain they quickly made
their own.</p>

<p>To avoid producing a dearth of paper at <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Tralee, whence I procured my last supply, I
shall now pack you up, and placing you in the
car of a balloon, permit you no longer to loiter
your happy hours amid scenes of enchantment.
You must neither land on Ronayve's Island, nor
accompany me to Fure Lake, nor wander by
moonlight through the Abbey of Muccruss, nor
toil to the top of the eagle's nest, nor visit Dunlow-gap,
Mangerton punch-bowl, nor any other
spot in this region of fascination. Were I to
indulge your passion for romance, and allow
you to linger any longer at Killarney, I should
fear your becoming a hermit, and requesting
Lord Kenmare's permission to build a cell, in
which the remainder of your days would be dedicated
to solitude and contemplation. Take
then your bird's-eye view of the map, as it lies
spread beneath you; return to your inn; with
a mind torn between love and curiosity, quit
the society of our charming female companions,
leaving them under the care of Messieurs Otway,
Oliphant, and Bentley senior, descend from
your balloon, mount a rough Kerry poney, and
if you can ride like a Tartar through the desert, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
you may join Russell, Annesley, Frederick,
Bentley <i>secundus</i>, and your humble servant, in
a two day's trip over Kenmare mountain, the
Priest's leap, and through Neddeen to Bantry.
Oh Glengariffe, surpassing Glengariffe! thou
"brightest gem of the Western wave," in what
words am I to paint thee?</p>

<p>This transcendent spot was the limit of our
excursion, and how can I, in general terms,
more aptly sum up its attractions than in telling
you, that <i>reeking</i>, as we were, from Killarney,
the matchless scenery of which was still vibrating
on every retina, shadowed in our imaginations
and resting in the hearts of all our party, who
felt as if nature was reposing, admiration
drained to its dregs, and language run out, by
all that we had been called upon to see, think,
and feel, so recently, Glengariffe strung each
palsied nerve anew. We rose "like giants refreshed
with wine," and experienced that delight
which only the highest excitement of
mental or physical excellence occasionally produces,
namely a consciousness of power within
ourselves, of which, till thus extraordinarily elicited, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
we do not dream of being in possession.
Perhaps this is one of the most pleasurable feelings
of the human mind, and we now enjoyed it
rapturously, surprising our own ears with the
awakened flow of eloquence, poured out from
fountains which might have been supposed already
exhausted; and admiring beauties in all
around, the greatest charm of which, though
sometimes undiscerned, is the vivid reflection
from our own souls. But you must only glance
your eye along that blue expanse, and catch a
hasty glimpse of that splendid bay, where the
concentrated powers of France, while menacing
destruction, were themselves destroyed. Before
we regain our inn, and rejoin our friends,
you must pause for a moment with me in a
scene which, from its singularity, delayed our
retrograde progress.</p>

<p>Having mounted our shaggy steeds, we turned
our faces, like Sir Bertram, "to the wolds,"
and conceitedly imagined ourselves able to retrace,
unassisted, the homeward path; but we
were mistaken; and after proceeding for sometime
without meeting a living creature of whom <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
to ask the way, we at length espied a thing
scarcely human, naked almost to the hips, and
trotting at a quick, equal pace, holding a staff
horizontally in both hands, and having a tattered
weather-beaten bag that looked like an
old Spanish wine skin, strapped upon his back.</p>

<p>"Who, and what are you?" exclaimed Russel.</p>

<p>This was not a conciliating address, and accordingly
it was rudely answered: "May be as
good as yourself. I am a post; and my father
was a post before me."</p>

<p>This letter-carrier for so we interpreted him
to be, never relaxed his steady trot, nor condescended
to be angry. Calm contempt appeared
to be the feeling which dictated his reply;
and he would have passed on his way with-deigning
to look behind him, if Frederick had
not said, in his cheerful manner, "My good
fellow, I know that you are the very man to tell
us how we shall get into the track that leads
over the mountain to Killarney, for I have lost
my way, and my friends here are strangers?"</p>

<p>The youth immediately became a <i>poste restante</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and gazing benignantly on Frederick,
setting his voice to a very different modulation
from that in which he first spoke and resting
his chin on the staff which he now stuck into
the ground, he replied, "Why then, indeed,
I'd do more than that for ye. Go down till
you see the smoke, then turn to the left and
face north'ards; turn again to the west, and
you'll find a track that will bring you out at
the kiln by a short cut, and then you can't miss
your way any more, but will get down into the
<i>illegant</i> new road, along the upper lake which is
so lonesome, and smothered in trees, that you
might be <i>murthered</i> there in all aise, and pitched
over into the lake, and no one know what become
of you during ash nor oak."</p>

<p>"And pray," said Frederick, "how am I
to find out north and west in this strange
place."</p>

<p>"Then sure, your honour, I suppose, isn't
such a poor scholar as that you wouldn't know
very well by the sun."</p>

<p>Fred. gave the poor fellow a shilling, and encouraged
with this agreeable notice, of the perfect <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
<i>convenience</i> with which we could be "<i>murthered</i>,"
we pursued our route; and found the
instructions which he had received, accurate
to a tittle. The smoke, which was the first
finger-post in the journey, brought us into a
deep ravine, wild, barren, and silent as the
grave, yet judging by the wreaths that seemed
to be sent up from numerous chimnies that were
invisible, populous of human life. We looked
for habitations but there was not a single roof to
be seen, nor an individual to be met with. Curiosity
prompted us to approach nearer to this
uncommon defile; and here we found numbers
of poor creatures, who, terrified at the sound of
so many horses' feet, and dreading a visit from
the police, were employed in hastily extinguishing
their fires. We speedily tranquillized their
minds, and then received that generous welcome
and hospitality which the poorest sons
and daughters of Erin, never fail to extend to
the stranger.</p>

<p>To be a <i>stranger</i>, far from exciting suspicion
here, is a free passport to the best which these
kind people possess. Whiskey was all which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
these had to offer, for this was a little colony of
illicit distillers. We tasted their <i>pottein</i> (their
name here for the purest spirit) to oblige our
hosts, and scattering a few pieces of silver
amongst them, turned to the left, then to the
north, made for the kiln, and were just descending
from the moor, into something resembling
a road, when a figure stalking along the
horizon, of apparently gigantic stature, arrested
our attention; we drew up, and as he
<i>neared</i> us, we beheld indeed a prodigious form
of at least six feet in height, black as Erebus,
skin, clothes, and all; and armed with a pole of
fully ten feet in length, terminated by an immense
bush of holly. Warned by the former
incivility which he had excited, Russell now
thought proper to leave all enquiries to Frederick,
who with a kind, "good morrow my lad,"
begged to know where this Patagonian was
going, and why so accoutered?</p>

<p>"Plase your honour," answered the spectre,
"I am the sweep o'the mountains, and I'm
going yander to clane some chimblies for the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
people."</p>

<p>What grotesque habits, and how extra-ordinary
the mixture in this country of barbarism
and civilization!</p>

<p>Arrived at length, we found all the pleasure
of joining such a circle as we had left behind,
doubled by our short absence.</p>

<p>An excursion such as this to Killarney,
brings the people who are included in it, so informally
and so constantly together as to preclude
the possibility, I should think, of neutral
feelings at parting. This is a strong proof, one
would imagine, that a state of life mid-way between
poverty and riches is the surest soil of
domestic felicity. Rise <i>above</i> this middle standard,
and you soar beyond the want of sympathy,
and owe your principal gratifications, it
may be, to fortune alone. Fall <i>below</i> the medium,
and the anxieties of life press so painfully
as to annihilate, from an opposite cause, that dependence
on each other, which constitutes the
perfection of human happiness.</p>

<p>Falkland, did you ever expect to hear these <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
sentiments from your friend Arthur Howard?</p>

<p>We had now passed ten days in an intercourse
so intimate, so intellectual, the tastes,
the faculties, of each individual had been
brought into such activity, that, like the manufacturers
of soda water who compress three or
four atmospheres into a pint bottle, we seemed
to have condensed into one short fortnight,
more solid enjoyment of life, than would eke out
half a century in the vapid inanity of fashionable
routine. During this blissful dream, we
had known nothing of factitious wants, nor
artificial accommodations. There was a simplicity,
a reality in our pleasures which deluded
us into forgetfulness that the "sweetest are still
the fleetest," because they seemed so natural
that one did not see <i>why</i> they were to cease;
and when the last evening actually arrived, it
came with a shock as dreadful, as if entirely unexpected.
The fastidiousness of former habits
had vanished. Our apartments were large, and
numerous enough, our cold dinners were eaten
with appetite. We had felt no blank, and we
desired no accession to our comforts. Such <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
are the charms of <i>that</i> society which I reviled,
because I did not comprehend, and was unable
at first to appreciate its value. Alas! I know
it now too well; and yet I am better off than
my neighbours. I may hope to pass much of
my time with the Douglas family, while poor
Russell and Annesley, who are certainly minus
a heart each, may never see them again. The
former will not leave Glenalta, for which place
we set out to-morrow without trying his fate.
A few short months ago, and I should have ridiculed
the idea of Russell's being refused by
one of my country cousins. Handsome, gay,
musical, sought after, with fair prospects, and
good connections, that Russell could not command
any possible Miss Douglas, or Miss any
thing else, possessing no more than five or six
thousand pounds, was I confess what never occurred
to me as matter of doubt. I now feel
apprehensions that my friend may suffer disappointment,
as with all the penetration which I
can exercise, I perceive nothing in Charlotte's
manner beyond easy kindness and polite attention.</p>

<p> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>Annesley is not a free agent: <i>his</i> views are
lost in clouds; and should little Kepple live to
be of age, his father may levy fines, and cut
off the entail which will otherwise give the estate
of Compton to Frank, who will have little or
nothing, except in this event, and he will therefore
never betray his feelings towards Emily.
Perhaps he may hope that in absence they will
wear away; but were this not the case, Annesley
has great self-command, and would suffer
much rather than commit himself. I know too
that he has pride, which would ill brook defeat,
and in his present circumstances he could not
expect to be successful.</p>

<p>I think that I can perceive a knitting of your
brow, and can also tell the cause of it. I anticipate
your question, and reply, before it is
asked, No, there is not the slightest tendency
in my cousin's manner indicating that Annesley's
departure will leave a single pang in her
breast. Emily is free as the air of her mountains;
so let your forehead resume its unruffled serenity.</p>

<p>How various were the feelings of the individuals <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
that composed our party, and how different
from those which accompanied us when
we left that place a fortnight ago. In my
aunt's face I read the word <i>home</i> written in every
direction. Spite of all her efforts to be cheerful,
suppressed pain sat on every feature during
her stay at Killarney; and spite of all the natural
glow which beamed in the countenances of
her children amid the pure pleasures of that enchanting
scene, their mother's looks so far
alloyed their happiness as to make them sometimes
long for return on <i>her</i> account, and therefore
on their own. Mr. Otway, too, retraced
the road to Lisfarne with calm satisfaction;
but for the younger members of the group
(and I believe that I may also include Mrs.
Fitzroy) the prospect of a <i>break-up</i>, the certainty
of parting, and the uncertainty of meeting
again, corroded every heart.</p>

<p>We reached Glenalta in a beautiful sun-set,
but the letters which awaited our return have so
completely absorbed my thoughts, that I pass
over sufficient materials, <i>at our</i> rate of corresponding,
to furnish half a quire of paper, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
hasten to say that a few lines from Louisa bring
me the disagreeable intelligence that I have
offended my mother, who desires me not to
go to town, but to set out directly for the Continent
and join you. This I shall only do in
case of finding that my presence in London is of
no use; and thither I must fly. Mrs. Fitzroy
offers me a seat in her caleche if I remain here
another week; and as there is nothing to prevent
this short delay, I have arranged to be her
companion. Russell and Annesley leave this in
two days, and you will probably meet them ere
long; at all events they will take care that this
packet reaches you in safety. I have inclosed
for your amusement the letter to which Mr.
Otway alluded at Glena, when the conversation
between Mrs. Fitzroy and old Bentley
induced him to mention having lately received
it. Mrs. Fitzroy desired a copy, and permits
me to send it to you, provided that you return
it whenever you have an opportunity. I inclose
you also Louisa's letter.</p>

<p>You shall hear from me after I reach Grosvenor-square, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
and will not envy my feelings
in the interim.</p>

<h2>LETTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Miss Howard to A. Howard, Esq.</span></p>


<p>(<i>Inclosed in the preceding.</i>)</p>


<p>
My dear Arthur,
</p>

<p>Your letter has made me gloomy, and my
mother's temper does not improve my spirits:
she is very angry with you, and so offended by
the style of your remarks on Adelaide's approaching
marriage, that so far from wishing
your presence, I am commissioned to say, it
is my mother's express desire that you should
not come to town till the ceremony is over.
As you are not yet <i>quite</i> of age, you could
not be of any absolute use at present; and
she will contrive, upon the good faith of your
assistance when you are enabled to give your
aid, to supply the immediate necessity for
money by borrowing on bond. This is her
message; but as her anxiety that you should <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
quit your present situation is fully equal to
her wish that you should not come here, she
would be glad if you were to <i>go</i> to the Continent;
and as your friend Falkland is somewhere
in Italy, and his company may be an inducement
to <i>immediate</i> arrangements, she has
no objection to your joining him and his
tutor wherever they may be. It is my mother's
design to hasten the marriage as quickly
as possible. She means to inform Crayton
that you have seriously hurt your leg, which
will be sufficient excuse for your non-appearance;
and should he ever discover that you
have left Glenalta to go abroad while it might
be supposed that you could not stir from your
sofa, it will be easy to make out a new <i>version</i>;
or if the wedding is <i>over</i>, as soon as we hope
that it <i>will</i> be, we shall not care much about a
slight inconsistency which will not signify a
<i>rush</i> when the deed is done.</p>

<p>You look grave, but really it cannot be
helped. Nothing could be worse than any interruption
to the nuptials of Clayton and Adelaide;
it must not be; and though I <i>believe</i> him <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
to be a gambler, and <i>know</i> him to be a dunce,
our sister is willing to wear his coronet, and excuse
his errors and deficiencies. For myself, I am
not sorry that the bustle of coachmakers, jewellers,
milliners, &amp;c. in which we are involved, prevents
my having time to <i>think</i> much, for I am
low, and quite out of humour. What you say
of the world is true enough, and no one feels
<i>how</i> true except he is carried round like a fly
upon its wheel; but to stand still is worse: it
makes one's head giddy to pause; and the country
after all is so flat, so utterly devoid of interest,
that tiresome as I <i>confess</i> a London life
to be, any thing is better than the cobwebs of retirement.
A rural bower sets one to sleep, even
in imagination, and the only part of the system
kept <i>alive</i> in retreat is the muscular apparatus
by which we yawn.</p>

<p>If I could find out any "Royal road" to happiness,
I should like to cut many of my acquaintances;
but till I do, they must be endured,
idle and silly as they are.</p>

<p>Here comes a man with Ady's diamonds, and
I am called to council. I will write a line to Paris, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
<i>poste restante</i>; so as you will probably make at
once for the French capital, as a central point;
you will there receive intelligence of <i>our advancement</i>
to <i>the peerage</i>. I will send you the
newspapers that you may see how the paragraph
<i>runs</i>. Old Lord Hawkston, being our hundred
and fiftieth cousin, <i>La Madre</i> applies to him to
act your part in giving the bride away.</p>

<h2>LETTER XX.</h2>

<p class="center">[Alluded to by Mr. Otway, addressed to him, and inclosed to
Charles Falkland.]</p>

<p>
My dear Friend,
</p>

<p>I hasten to obey your injunctions, and give
you some account of your amiable kinswoman,
Clara Browne. On reaching York, I found a
letter from her so earnestly praying me to visit
at her house, and so warmly expressive of her
wishes to make, as she kindly called me, "one
of her oldest and most valued friends" acquainted
with her husband, that I prepared as
soon as I could to accept the invitation, and
set out for Stockton. I found Clara the picture
of contentment, and surrounded by all the substantial
comforts and rational elegancies of life.
Nothing could exceed the openness and affection
with which she received me; and I was welcomed
by Mr. Browne in such a manner as to assure <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
me, in the most gratifying language, that I was
not a stranger to him. In a few days after my
arrival at his house, a letter on urgent business
required his presence in a distant part of the
country; and I yielded to the united entreaties
of my two friends that I would take care of
Clara till his return in two days from D&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Clara and her sister were now my only companions;
and upon the first opportunity which
occurred in a <i>tête-à-tête</i> walk, the former demanded
of me a full, free, and candid declaration
of my opinion respecting the object of her
choice. I told her truly that I liked her husband
extremely, and congratulated her with all
my heart on having united herself to a man of
high principle and worth; adding, that the suavity
of his temper, mildness of his manners, and
polite acquaintance with the world, attracted my
admiration as sincerely as the graver qualities
of his mind commanded my esteem and respect.</p>

<p>"Clara," said I, "you know that I was always
a plain man, and as I am an old fellow, too,
and used to abuse your fastidiousness in days
of yore, I have the more pleasure in praising <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
now the sensible, excellent person with whom
you have allied yourself. There <i>was</i> a time
when nothing short of a galaxy of light, a constellation
of genius and talent, would have satisfied
you. I often told you then that you
would one day or other discover your mistake,
and I hoped not experimentally. I told you that
good sense and a sweet disposition were of more
value than all the <i>brilliants</i> upon which you set
so high a price. May I not now wish to hear
from your own lips that you have proved the
truth of my doctrine?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Clara, "I glory in my renunciation
of the follies which marked my
youth; and, as dear Edward Otway will take
the same interest that you do in my change, I
shall egotize a little, and through you make confession
to him of the motives which produced
it. You remember, both of you, how I worshipped
intellect, and if I am not too insignificant
to have made so lasting an impression,
you may recollect the silly energy with which I
used to descant on moral virtue, and say that,
like air and water, it was certainly indispensably <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
necessary, but so common&mdash;so entirely a
thing <i>of course</i>, that it slipped out of calculation,
and only served as a vehicle for the ingredients
of happiness, without ever presuming to be an
item in the recipe. In short, all the truly valuable
parts of human character were mere <i>negatives</i>
in my flippant creed, while to genius,
intellect, and splendid abilities, did I hold
mankind to be indebted for whatever exalts
the human species. Under this delusion I
passed my early years, that period of life
which the French call "<i>La premiere jeunesse</i>;"
and at five-and-twenty was still as much inclined
as ever to be a dreamer, if the marriage
of my two dearest associates to what the world
styles <i>prodigiously clever men</i>, had not awakened
me to clearer views, and, by a striking practical
lesson, caused me to understand that it was
possible to shine brightly as the glow-worm at
a distance, and be a sightless grub, when brought
close to the eye. As one experimental fact
is better than a world of theory, I began to
apply the melancholy instruction which I derived
from the unhappiness of my friends, to my <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
own profit. The result was a firm conviction
that plain sense, and gentle temper, resting on
the foundation of a sincerely religious and moral
character, are the very best ingredients to depend
upon in the cup of domestic union; and
that with a few beautiful but very rare exceptions,
the worst companion of earth at a family
fire-side, is a <i>man of genius</i>. I know that an
instance now and then occurs to prove the <i>possibility</i>
of higher things. I know that minds
have sometimes met, bringing the richest gifts
of head and heart in heavenly communion to
the altar; such signal deviations, however, from
the common history of mankind, but serve to
establish the opposite rule, repressing those
visions of romance, which only entail disappointment.</p>

<p>"When I had paid a visit of some months to
each of my friends, I perceived that their husbands
were men of whom they might be <i>vain</i>
but could not be <i>fond</i>. Isabella, the eldest, had
married one of your "admirable Creighton"
sort of people. He was a Mr. Mills, and set up
for a person of universal science, taste, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
talent. There was nothing too high or too low
for the omnivorous appetite of his ambition;
and he has often reminded me of Johnson's
sarcasm directed against Goldsmith, "Sir, he
would be jealous of Punch;" and so would
Mr. Mills. There was no trial of skill, however
humble its object, in which he would not
exert his powers for the pleasure of a triumph.
He knew every thing, at least superficially, and
astonished every society of which he was a
member. How clever! what talents! such
a memory! such universal information! echoed
from room to room whenever he appeared; and
the sweet savour of this incense is the food upon
which he lives, it is his daily bread, and to
purchase it his continual employment. How
Mr. Mills should ever have married, would
surprise, had it not been that the general habit
of mankind protesting against single blessedness,
he thought it necessary to prove that he possessed
superlative powers of captivation, and
accordingly set his eye on my poor friend,
who, in an hour of infatuation, consented to
be his bride. That purpose being accomplished, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
some newer project succeeded. He lives as if
the world were indeed a stage, and he a player,
continually occupied in learning or rehearsing a
part for the next exhibition, and his wife is
no better in his eyes than candle-snuffer to the
theatre (though far surpassing him in all that
gives solid dignity to human character), because
she is too wise and too honest to flatter
him.</p>

<p>"My younger friend, Lavinia, is just as miserably
yoked as her sister, though Mr. Dormer
does not resemble Mr. Mills. The latter hates
society as much as the former courts it; and <i>his</i>
weakness is that of authorship. He writes for
every newspaper, magazine, and review, that will
give a place to his lucubrations. He worries all
the members of parliament with prosing dissertations
on political economy, finance, agriculture,
and commerce; he wastes his property in trying
experiments which never come to good. The
restless activity of Mr. Dormer never slumbers,
and is exhibited in endless schemes, the utter
failure of which has no influence in deterring
him from new attempts. He set up a school at <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
considerable expense, hired a master and mistress
at a large salary, to teach in a method of
his own device, and found at the end of three
years, that the children had not learned to spell.
His sheep were all shorn in the winter to prove
the excellence of a theory on the fineness of
wool; but, as might naturally be expected, the
poor animals all died. He plants trees at mid-summer
to demonstrate that those people are
mistaken who prefer spring and autumn for the
purpose, but as you may easily anticipate, never
beholds a leaf on any of his ill-fated groves,
which, after a few months of "hope deferred,"
are consigned to the oven. He drowned a
favourite dog the other day in trying a life-boat
of his own construction; and broke his arm last
year by a fall from a balloon which he had inflated
with some new gas, and Icarus-like, would
essay himself with <i>such</i> success as attended the
first flight of the Dædalian wings. Though he
lives at home, all the endearing relations of life
are despised and neglected. He hates the sight
of two lovely children, because they interrupt
him; and though I passed four months with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
Lavinia, I never saw her husband come but
twice to the room where she and I sat in the
mornings: oh the first occasion, to ask for one
of her harp strings, with which to make experiment
on a new theory of vibration; and upon
the second, to beg a bit of gum from his wife's
drawing-box, with which, to secure one of his
retorts. Always in a hurry, he makes a perpetual
<i>breeze</i> through the house, by the rapidity
of his motions; and, as his hands are generally
imbrued in chemical compounds, not of Arabian
odour, I cannot say that the gale thus stirred,
wafts perfume on its wing. Nothing can rouse
his attention to his own affairs, which would fall
into utter confusion were it not for the good
sense of his wife. He dislikes the neighbouring
gentry, because he does not consider them
people of <i>talent</i>; and expends his money without
any reference either to ornament or real
utility, but simply with the vain-glorious hope
of advancing his individual fame as a man of
genius.</p>

<p>"Thus instructed by the shipwreck of others,
I did not dare to fancy that my bark would <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
escape where goodlier vessels had foundered. I
therefore resolved, that should it be my fate to
encounter the voyage of matrimony, I would try
another course; and though sunken rocks might
mar my hopes, I determined that I would steer
clear of the quicksands which had been fatal to
my friends. It is but justice to the long contemned
counsel of you and my valuable Edward
Otway, to finish my story with a tribute to <i>him</i>
who furnished the comment on your text.</p>

<p>"Adolphus is remarkable for an excellent
understanding and correct judgment. Others
may outshine him in original powers of mind,
but none can surpass him in the tasteful appreciation
of merit, whatever be its form, and
wherever it exists. Kind and unselfish, he can
praise in others those attributes which he does
not himself possess; and every scheme in which
he is engaged, has for its object the comfort and
advantage of his fellow-creatures. If he find
that his views are erroneous, or detect a flaw in
their application, far from becoming the <i>advocate</i>,
because he was the <i>proposer</i> of a plan, he
resigns his particular views with a noble ingenuousness, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
and, confessing that they were
either unfounded, or not suited to the case, seeks
farther light from whatever source is most likely
to afford information. This complete absence
of pertinacity has a powerful effect in enhancing
the weight of his opinion in every deliberation,
as it is well known, that he will not adhere to
the wrong side because it is that which he had
first adopted. While others pursue the 'bubble
reputation' abroad, Adolphus seeks to be loved
at home, and his own fire-side is the scene in
which the best energies of his mind, and the
purest affections of his heart are expanded. I
am reclaimed by his virtues from my visionary
absurdities, and shall endeavour to make all the
reparation in my power for having wandered so
far from the truth by <i>preaching</i> a <i>crusade</i> to the
youth of my own sex, who may be inclined to
deviate into the labyrinth from which I was
myself so happily extricated. If you have any
female friends to whom my tale may be useful,
advise them from the experience of Clara
Browne, against an overweening admiration of
talents without due reflection on the manner in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
which such talents are associated. Tell them
that books, and occasional conversation may
supply all that is necessary of mental variety,
while <i>nothing</i> is capable of compensating for the
want of common sense, disinterestedness, and
affection."</p>

<p>Clara ceased; and as I remained a month at
Stockton, after her husband's return, I am enabled
to bear a willing testimony to the fidelity
of her narrative, as well as to the soundness of
her views: and as I know how glad you will be
to hear of her happiness, I have given you this
detail without fear of your being fatigued by its
perusal.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Douglas to Mrs. E. Sandford.</span></p>


<p>My dearest Elizabeth will believe that Glenalta
has charms which even Killarney cannot
boast for me. Yes; though the word <i>home</i>
never meets my eye or ear without producing
a <i>gulp</i>, which tells of other days, when that little
monosyllable of four letters contained the <i>world</i>
for me, yet repose is so necessary to my existence,
that I sighed for return to my peaceful
glen, and the pain of concealing every feeling
that warred against the happiness of my beloved
children, from their acute observation, increased
my restraint, and has converted the enjoyment
of my <i>cell</i> into more positive pleasure than I
have felt for years. How gracious are the mercies
shed upon our daily path, and how tender
the dispensation which so often renders what we
conceive to be inflictions, conducive to our comfort! <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Elizabeth, my spirits are unusually depressed,
but you are expecting an answer to your
letter, and I will not suffer my pen to forget its
duty, nor wander from the subject of your inquiry,
till I have given you what little aid, my
longer experience of your present cares, may
contribute. You think that my advice would
be, that you should resign yourself exclusively
to the charm of such society as you find amongst
the Stanleys, No, dear friend; I would only
allow you to <i>prefer</i> them; but there is a net of
kind, expansive benevolence which it would seem
as if Nature loved to throw more widely in scenes
of rural life than in any other. "Man made
cities, God formed the country." It is very
true, every heart must acknowledge the distinction,
and yours my friend would desire to emulate,
as far as the imperfect creature is enabled
to do, the bounty of that Being who has placed
you where all the sweet charities of fellowship
may be called into exercise. I do not mean
that you should mingle indiscriminately, nor
<i>over-much</i> in society: I would only say avoid
unkindness; exclusion should be reserved for the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
unworthy, but not visited on those who have
only the misfortune to be less pleasing than their
neighbours. A judicious <i>assortment</i> will always
prevent the disagreeable effects which sometimes
spring from neglect of selecting such people only
as harmonize with each other in manners and
modes of thinking. I should be more diffuse
upon this subject, were there the slightest danger
of your supposing for a moment that I could
be the advocate of an <i>electioneering</i> system. You
know how I abhor the arts of popularity, and
revere independence; but human virtues and
vices are often separated from each other by
such imperceptible shades, that in giving ourselves
credit for the performance of the one, it is
too often our lot to glide into the other. Selfishness
is an arch fiend, and ever at hand to whisper
temptation. I know that it is a prevailing opinion
amongst a large number of respectable and
worthy people, that we are bound to make profession
of our creeds in the highways, and in the
corners of our streets, that every sentence which
we utter should tell of the sect to which we belong,
every article of dress which we wear be a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
symbol of distinction; and every person with
whom we converse, every book that we open,
be submitted to an ordeal, and pronounced upon,
by a few self-elected judges, before we venture
to pursue acquaintance with the one, or
advance in perusal of the other.</p>

<p>I cannot enter into this system of parcelling
out mankind by quite so restrictive a rule; I see
nothing of all this in the inspired precepts of
the great Founder of our faith, whose beautiful
simplicity of doctrine and extensive charity of
example, are too little dwelt upon as matter of
imitation, while His name is mingled with disgusting
familiarity in every trifling discourse.</p>

<p>Oh, my friend, human nature is so frail that
we should not <i>tempt</i> our pride, or our vanity,
by putting on external marks that may deceive
even our own hearts, and persuade us that
we are better than others. Let our consistency
be seen in our <i>lives</i>; our religion shine through
our actions; our tastes be proclaimed by our
preferences; and let us not <i>profess</i> at all, let us
not belong <i>exclusively</i> to one party, or one
preacher. Let us catch illumnination from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
those who possess more than we do, contributing
our own light to such as have less. Do not suffer
your dear girls to assume names or badges.
Do not permit them to be tied down by observances.
Let their books, their society, their
opinions, and their tastes, spring from their
<i>habits</i> and their <i>principles</i>. It is an <i>inverted</i>
method, to begin with the mere trappings, and
argue to the indwelling of the spirit, from the
rigidity of the letter. Set up no sign-posts;
use no cabalistic phraseology; make no premature
vows, and adopt no rule but that of your
Bible in matters of religion. In matters of inferior
concern, I would advise equally against
precipitancy either in proscribing or adopting.
<i>Parade</i> is of all things to be avoided; be natural,
be kind. You will find that some, of whom you
may at first have formed high expectation, are
over-rated, whilst others may rise in your estimation
as you know them better. A little <i>time</i>
settles our modes of life, and regulates our conduct
without any <i>eclat</i> much more consistently
than any pre-arrangement of our own, and with
a little patience we may gradually <i>sift</i> people <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and things, till we find ourselves placed as
nearly as circumstances permit, in the situation
most suited to our characters. My little experience
leads me to certain conclusions which had
they been earlier impressed upon my mind I
should have been spared much anxiety. One of
them is, that in the beginning of our career we
all <i>plan</i> too much. We take as it were a <i>survey</i>
of all the territory that lies spread before us, and
sitting down in the pride of full possession, we
scan the map of futurity, dazzle our imaginations
with mines that are to be dug, and riches that
are to be realized, amuse our fancies with palaces
to be built, and forests to be planted, worshipping
within our breasts the idol of self-complacency,
while we contemplate <i>ourselves</i> as the
<i>great</i> engineers whose skill is to operate these
mighty improvements. We <i>assume</i> too much,
we <i>trust</i> too little; we know nothing but the
present, and the present we despise. Our
limited vision cannot extend beyond a point,
and we strain our eyes over all created space.
<i>Little</i> things and <i>proximate</i> purposes, make up
the real sum of happiness and virtue: but we <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
pass by these in contemptuous disdain, to aim
at the great and the distant; the undefined and
generally unattainable. True wisdom is surely
to watch with our best attention, and cultivate
with assiduity, the daily, the hourly circumstances
which arise in our path, leaving the
widely spreading consequences of unseen result,
to Him who alone is acquainted with the final
issues.</p>

<p>I have never known a failure in any wish of
my own respecting the good of my family, which
I could not resolve into over solicitude in <i>looking</i>
too far, and <i>doing</i> too much in my <i>own
strength</i>. Examine your heart; be sure that it
is single, that no divided empire <i>there</i> is likely
to split its councils, and lead to compromise or
dissimulation. <i>Simplicity</i> of design is a panoply
of power. Clad in its protective guardianship,
put up your prayers with confidence for that
aid, without which all your efforts will be abortive,
and rising from your knees refreshed by the
blessed assurance that the sincere suppliant is
<i>never</i> disregarded, go forth to your <i>daily</i> task;
as you are taught to ask for your <i>daily</i> bread. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Endeavour to perform the little duties which are
allotted to a <i>given hour</i>. Neither perplex your
thoughts, nor weaken your sight by scrutinizing
the hidden things, and pouring through the
darksome mists of future time, but leave it to
<i>become</i> the present. At its appointed period
your duty is declared, and its boundary is traced:
be that your <i>practical</i> object. What mind indeed
of "lofty pitch" would be contented with
the prison that I prescribe, were I not confining
the consideration to that part which we are
individually called upon to <i>act</i> in life; but you
do not mistake my meaning. Ah! who would
wish to walk over "the field of Marathon, or
wander amid the ruins of Iona," without desiring
to possess the power of abstracting thought
from the fleeting moment that eludes our grasp,
to expatiate in the mighty vast of years gone by?
Or who that has ever loved and lost, would clip
the spirit's wing, and stay its airy flight from
stretching beyond this narrow strait of time and
space into the boundless regions of eternal
blessedness, where it is not forbidden to seek
amongst the dazzling host, the happy myriads <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
of the sky, for <i>one</i> bright seraph, dearer than
the rest, towards whom the newly emancipated
stranger flies to meet its fondest though unearthly
welcome? <i>Can</i> there be danger&mdash;<i>is</i>
there impiety&mdash;in this vision which steals with
heavenly influence on my solitary musings?
Oh, if there be, speak, my Elizabeth, and I will
try to curb my <i>waking</i> thoughts, and turn imploringly
to <i>sleep</i> for the precious imagery
which perhaps my day-light dreams ought not
to mingle.</p>

<p>There are days so sad, and feelings so overwhelming,
that to make war against their flow
is as fruitless as to oppose a barrier to the sea.
Forgive me. <i>You</i> are not one of the unskilful
comforters who attempt to impart consolation
by checking the tide of sorrow. <i>You</i> understand
better the nature of the human heart, and are
aware that a little kind sympathy is the truest
balm which friendship can bestow.</p>

<p>I will now impart to you some circumstances
which have weighed upon spirits, at <i>best</i> so tremblingly
poised, that the slightest addition to
their usual burthen destroys the balance. As I <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
mentioned to you, my excursion to Killarney
was, in itself, a great effort. <i>Such</i> scenery, and
sweet music, are the most powerful exciters, in
my mind, to a train of association which I dread
in company. Memory is so acutely painful,
from the minuteness with which its traces are engraved,
and the fidelity of its pictures, that I fly
from whatever is likely to unlock the stores, and
present to my view <i>much</i> that I dare not contemplate,
unless I am alone. The delight,
however, of gratifying my dear children overcame
every other consideration: and I accompanied
a party composed of admirable materials,
but too numerous and too gay for me. I had
not been long from home before I felt myself, for
the first time, involved in those cares which, as my
children grow up, I must expect to encounter.</p>

<p>My dear friend Mrs. Fitzroy, whose enlivening
society charmed the whole group, was the
first to awaken my attention to the expressions,
both by looks and manner, of feelings in Mr.
Russell's mind, which her quick eye discovered
that Charlotte had excited. I have such perfect
confidence in the delicacy of my dear girls, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
that I was spared all solicitude on the score of
<i>conduct</i>; but I watched with uneasiness the progress
of a sentiment which, as it met no return,
will I fear be the cause of pain to an amiable
and an accomplished young man. I find that he
is acquainted with you, and, as he talks of going
into Derbyshire on his return from France, you
will probably see him, and perchance hear his
story from his own lips.</p>

<p>The conversation, in which he made known
his attachment to Charlotte, took place on the
evening preceding his departure, and was so unlike
the common place dialogues upon such occasions,
that I could not, when it was repeated
to me, repress a smile in the midst of more serious
impressions. It was a lovely evening, and
the young people had, as usual, strayed away
from the elders, whose more sober views of happiness,
and less active powers of locomotion,
happily prepare us, as time advances, for the
final rest.</p>

<p>As lovers always contrive to find the opportunity
which they are seeking, Russell soon detached
Charlotte from the group, by some appeal <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
to her taste in particular; and when removed
from all ears, save her own, he exclaimed
(and, poor fellow, I believe with genuine truth),
"How wretched is the <i>ending</i> of such happiness!"</p>

<p>"It is indeed," replied my innocent Charlotte,
who willingly perhaps gave her companion
a share in the feeling which she echoed.</p>

<p>Perhaps assured by this encouraging sympathy
that all might be as he wished, Russell continued:
"Even inanimate objects interest the
heart when we are about to quit them."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Charlotte, "and when one lives
entirely in retreat, where the living objects are
few, we do <i>really</i> love trees, rocks, and streams,
as if they were human beings. Is it not for this
reason that mountaineers, like the Swiss, Scotch,
and Irish, are fonder of their homes than any
other nation?"</p>

<p>This is not what Russell wanted to know, or
cared to inquire respecting. "To waste love
upon trees and rocks, when so many of our own
species are dying for want of the food lavished
upon <i>them</i>, is not right," said Russell; "and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
<i>you</i> are more guilty than any one, inasmuch as
your affection is more prized."</p>

<p>Charlotte interrupted what she perceived to
be a <i>compliment</i>, by answering: "You must not
make <i>speeches</i>. The love that one feels for rural
objects, long known, and seen with daily interest,
can never interfere with better affections.
It is a different thing, and <i>you</i> must know how
<i>very</i> different, as you have a father, mother, and
sisters." The honest air of directness, which I
can imagine to have accompanied this <i>reasoning</i>
upon love, was not very favourable to farther
dalliance.</p>

<p>When the youthful heart is <i>first</i> excited, and
hope is felt that kindred feeling has touched the
soul in which it feels an interest, how exquisite
the happiness of developement! Like the beautiful
buds of early spring, the unfolding of each
individual scale that binds the young leaves is in
itself delightful, and we do not wish to lose a single
hour of <i>progressive</i> enjoyment, in impatience
to behold the crown of summer foliage. Did
you ever meet with an old book called "<i>Guadentio
di Lucca?</i>"&mdash;It is a story in which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
amongst some primitive race of people in South
America, I think the lovers are made to declare
their mutual sentiments by an interchange of
buds, and, as inclinations advance, the full-blown
flower.</p>

<p>But to return. Russell felt that his way was
retrograde, and therefore, making an effort, he
bounded over rocks, shrubs, and rivulets, and,
taking my sweet child by the hand, declared, in
the spirit of Hector to Andromache, though with
the difference between <i>is</i> and <i>might be</i>, that <i>all</i>
relations, however fond, concentrate in the object
of tender and devoted love. To hear a confession
of this nature, for the first time, must necessarily
produce confusion in the mind of so gentle
a being as Charlotte, and she told her sister
that she felt quite unable for a few minutes to collect
herself. Courage was imparted at length,
by the fear of conveying the opposite of what
she intended to communicate by her silence;
and, summoning resolution, she turned to our
young friend, and, thanking him kindly for the
preference which he had just expressed, added:</p>

<p>"I have many blessings, and I am very young.
It has never before occurred to me even to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
<i>think</i>, in my own case, of parting with such
treasures as I possess; and though I shall always
remember your visit to Glenalta as a period
of <i>great</i> pleasure, and <i>you</i> as an agreeable member
of our happy party, I can say no more."</p>

<p>Russell urged the usual arguments. "Surely
she did not mean to devote herself to a single
life. She might still have the society of mother,
sisters, brother. Marriage was the natural object
of life: it was the happiest lot when 'heart
met heart.'"</p>

<p>"And <i>how</i> can heart meet heart," replied
Charlotte, "on a three weeks' acquaintance?
<i>My</i> heart would require a much longer time for
disposing of itself, if I could disengage it from
the ties that bind it here; and I cannot imagine
how people should be either so vain, or so confiding
as to fancy that the foundation of happiness,
for perhaps a long life, can be laid in a
short moment of time."</p>

<p>Russell assured her that to the quick eye of a
lover, moments were years in bringing people
acquainted.</p>

<p>"Ah then," said Charlotte, "why are so <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
many married people unhappy?"</p>

<p>"They are just as well off in the end," answered
Russell, "as those who are single, and
certainly, till they discover their mistakes, much
happier."</p>

<p>"Well, my life," replied Charlotte, "is too
happy for any change of my <i>own</i> making, I believe.
If heaven deprived me of all that I love,
it is another question, but to deprive <i>myself</i>, I
cannot. My idea of marriage is not so favourable
as yours. I think it would require the most
powerful affection to render it a relation of real
felicity; and if not <i>that</i>, I should think it much
worse than even an unfortunate lot in single
life."</p>

<p>"Have I then <i>no</i> ground of hope," said
Russell.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I feel wholly disinclined to marry
any mortal at present," answered Charlotte.
"To you I am scarcely at all known; and I believe
that you are entirely mistaken in supposing
for an instant that we are suited to each other.
You and I have been educated in very different <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
schools, and could never sympathize."</p>

<p>"Do you then forget our musical sympathies.
Am I not devoted to your sweet melodies,
and have we not often admired them in
unison?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, certainly," said Charlotte, "but
music is a very little part of life.&mdash;We must not
stay any longer from our party, who, perhaps,
are wondering at our absence." Fanny appeared
precisely as Charlotte spoke the last word, and
the latter, seizing her sister's arm, was delighted
to find excuse for terminating the conversation.</p>

<p>The <i>last</i> evening is always sad, when those
who have been pleased in each other's society
are to part; but there is generally also some degree
of bustle, immediately preceding a journey,
which prevents the mind from dwelling on
gloomy thoughts, at least in <i>common</i> cases; and
as all were ignorant of what had happened, except
the pair immediately concerned, there was
less reserve than might have been anticipated
by any one who knew the fact that a proposal
had been made and rejected.</p>

<p>Mr. Annesley is a very sweet young man, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
and he too was happy enough in our friendly
circle to leave us with regret, which expressed
itself silently in a fine and speaking countenance.
We said farewell. The morning saw our visitors
set out at so early an hour that the track of their
carriage wheels alone reported of them when we
met at breakfast. Is there one bright, breathless,
listening joy that ever hung upon expected happiness
which is not familiar to my memory; and
is not that memory too a faithful register of every
pang that severed love could teach the heart?
How is it then, I wonder, that a tear is left for
minor griefs? Yet tears <i>will</i> flow; and I felt
the difference between the gladsome merriment
of approach, when our young friends were introduced
by Mrs. Fitzroy, and the melancholy
of their departing hour.</p>

<p>Still we are not bereaved of our guests all at
once, though I grieve to add that another week
will deprive me of dear Augusta Fitzroy, and my
charming Arthur. I have real pleasure in the
hope of presenting the latter to you one of these
days, and in the mean time I prepare you for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
finding him <i>almost</i> all that I desire to see him.
Such a change I did not imagine possible, as
has taken place in his mind since he has been
with us. The materials were in existence, no
doubt, but a London life has little need of
<i>heart</i>, and, therefore, <i>his</i> remained <i>hermetically
sealed</i>, except when brought into action by his
inestimable friend young Falkland, whose letters,
which Arthur prsserves like "leaves of the
Sybil", have rendered me acquainted with his
extra-ordinary virtues. <i>Now</i> in full exercise, my
dear nephew's affections are the source of happiness
to himself and delight to all around. His
abilities are shining, and, as habit strengthens the
power of applying them, I feel no doubt of his
becoming an ornament to society, and filling the
situation appointed for him by Providence so as
to set an example worthy of imitation. Domestic
anxiety at present weighs upon his spirits, proving
at once an acuteness of feeling and exalted
sense of rectitude, which promise a foundation
of future character, delightful to anticipate.</p>

<p>I must speak of George Bentley before I <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
conclude; and, to answer your inquiry in the
<i>first</i> instance, I am wholly unconscious of any
ground for his uncle's apprehensions, though
had I been aware of any such before we set out,
I should not have consented to his being of our
Killarney party; however, as Mr. Bentley followed
us, my anxiety was removed. The young
man is a fine and uncommon character: you
shall have a sketch of it as far as I can trace its
peculiarities. George Bentley offers a remarkable
instance to prove, that what climate is to
the vegetable kingdom, such to man is the moral
atmosphere by which he is surrounded in early
life. The temperature and aspect will not
indeed convert an oak into an elm; but as the
sapling of either, or of <i>any</i> kind may be
checked in its growth by the chill north-eastern
blast, and turned aside from the natural tendency
of its course; or, as the tender and
languid seedling may be improved in strength
by the care which tempers its exposure, and
provides shelter for its weakness, just so may a
particular bias of nature in the human mind be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
enfeebled or invigorated by circumstance, that
powerful agent in the completion of its structure.
Young Bentley came into the world with
excellent faculties and dispositions, but nothing
could be less favourable than that society in
which they were to be unfolded. It is not the
tutor's lessons, it is the manners and opinions
which <i>breathe</i> around us, that impart the <i>tone</i>
which distinguishes individuals from each other.
Young Bentley was formed in a different <i>mould</i>
of intellect from all his family, and soon discovered
in books, a companionship which was
denied in the circle of his immediate relations.
As he advanced in years, his mind, stimulated
by a general sense of hunger, rather than by
any discrimination of appetite, sought food for
the cravings of curiosity in a library of motley
mixture, accruing from various professional
hoards, and a medley of novels, annual registers,
and magazines, accumulated in a series of
generations, through family survivorship. He
was not met at home by either literary tact
or talent. No, nor by that sort of tact which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
sometimes supplies in a great degree, the defect
of one and the other.</p>

<p>Let loose as it were in an immense common,
without a guide to direct him in the choice of
his pasture, he devoured with avidity whatever
presented itself. He passed through school and
university with distinguished success, less the
meed of brilliant talent than the reward of
diligent application, and, unfortunately for himself,
was emancipated from the trammels of
education long before his age would permit him
to enter one of the learned professions for which
he was designed. The interval between the
termination of a young man's first course of
scholastic discipline, and the commencement of
his professional career, is perhaps by far the
most important period of existence in determining
his future fate, and no prudent parent
should permit that interval to be a long one.
The mind, relieved from its former habitual
restraint, and not yet <i>harnessed</i> in a new pursuit,
dashes wildly forward to revel in the
charms of liberty, and woe to him who enjoys
such length of holyday as to unfit him for returning <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
to the toilsome track in which he must
plod for daily bread. George Bentley employed
the <i>chasm</i> in <i>his</i> course, chiefly in reading
every thing upon which he could lay his hands
in the region of fiction and romance. His college
studies were ended before he had passed
that awkward time of life, when neither child,
nor man, the youth not knowing how to dispose
of the disproportioned length of legs and arms
by which he is encumbered, often flies from
polished society in which he cannot expect to
receive much notice; and young Bentley was
too amiable, too aspiring a character to seek in
low company the ease which he might have
attained at the expense of morality. Thus
while he was sliding into manhood, his days
were principally occupied in solitude, amidst a
heterogeneous mass of books, except during the
hours of occasional meeting with his parents,
brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Inelegant, and unrefined in the habits of
domestic economy, the circle of his relations
presented not a single likeness to any of the
pictures of imagination which were promiscuously <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
piled in his memory. What he <i>saw</i>, did
not in the least agree with what he <i>imagined</i>;
but there where two powerful motives, though
of opposite parentage, which co-operated to
prevent him from making the humiliating confession,
even to <i>himself</i>, that he could not trace
the most distant resemblance in his mother and
sisters, to the portraits which delighted him in
story. These motives were the <i>vice</i> of pride,
and the <i>virtue</i> of filial piety; and these combined,
determined him to try every effort that
was practicable in the way of twisting and turning,
letting out and taking in, to fit some of the
drapery with which his favourite novels abounded,
on those forms which his affectionate heart
would have gladly invested with whatever he
found most attractive. It would not do: and
he has at length given up the attempt, satisfied
to respect and esteem, what he cannot admire;
but the effect upon his mind of this war which
I have described between his tastes and his fortunes,
is singular. Let him describe character,
whether in actual existence, or of abstract contemplation;
and you would be surprised by the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
accuracy of his judgment, and the refinement of
his taste; yet from having studied books more
than men, and been debarred in early life from
referring the rules which he learned, to any
living examples which might have afforded a
practical illustration of them, he seems at a loss
in society, and gives one the idea of a person
who had attained to a perfect skill in geography
by mere inspection of maps, without ever having
stirred from a close room in the heart of London.
If such a person were suddenly brought
to the coast, he would be confused, and quite
unable for some time to follow the line of bays
and harbours, creeks and head-lands, with which
he was familiar on paper. When George
Bentley, at a later period extended his acquaintance,
and quitted home, a number of new
varieties were presented to his view, in which he
might have found specimens of every character;
but the most impressible time of life had passed
away, he did never possess, originally, the power
of comparison in any vividness, and the absence
of all encouragement to its exercise in youth,
has rendered him slow, now that he is of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
maturer age, in adapting objects for the first
time to his patterns. The eye accustomed only
to painting, does not come at <i>once</i> to criticise
sculpture; and a surgeon, who knows the whole
anatomy of the living subject, which <i>either</i> is
employed to represent, may be a dunce in <i>both</i>.
The things are <i>different</i>, and will remain so,
unless early habit and natural tact familiarize
the mind in applying them to each other, and
seeking similitudes between them. Young
Bentley's mind and manners in fine do not
amalgamate; one <i>layer</i> lies upon the other
like a <i>fineering</i>, which does not make a part of
the plank to which it is cemented, but is glued
on to a material less fine than itself. He <i>reasons</i>
more than he <i>feels</i>, is more solid than brilliant,
and wants that beautiful <i>lightning</i> of the mind
which plays sometimes round characters not half
so intrinsically valuable as his, with fascinating
illumination. Such is my brief sketch of 'poor
George,' as his uncle calls him. The future is
concealed in mist. If a child of mine ever love
young Bentley well enough to marry him, she
shall have my full consent, for I am <i>sure</i> of all <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the essentials that give security for substantial
peace. The graces which he wants <i>may</i> be dispensed
with. The virtues which he possesses
are indispensible; but I shall avoid giving <i>direction</i>
to the inclination of my girl, towards any
particular objects, not because I do not think
that many a parent might choose more wisely
than young people do for themselves; but there
is something perhaps inseparable from the
human heart, which renders us more willing to
excuse our own blunders, than those of even the
people whom we love best. "Youth is easily
deceived;" "love is blind," &amp;c. Many of these
flattering aphorisms occur to extenuate our own
errors, while the question of "how did <i>your</i> experience
fail, how did you commit a mistake?"
arises in the heart, though it may not be expressed
by the lips, of every young romancer,
who, finding life a chequered scene in which the
<i>tessalæ</i> of black and white, hold perpetual contrast,
attributes to the influence of a friend's
advice, the failure of those <i>generally</i> disappointed
hopes that paint the marriage state in colours
bright and fleeting as the imagination which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
supplies them.</p>

<p>This moment comes a letter from the India
House, to say that my poor brother, General
Douglas, has had so serious an attack of illness,
that his voyage to England is hastened, and we
are informed, that his arrival may be looked for
immediately. How this event may operate at
Glenalta, I cannot tell; but though "the
noiseless tenour of my way" should be disturbed,
I shall rejoice if it be permitted me to
afford comfort and assistance to the invalid.
Adieu, my Elizabeth.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Arthur Howard to Charles Falkland.</span></p>

<p>
My dear Charles,
</p>

<p>This letter, if not melancholy in its commencement,
will surely be tinged with a very
gloomy colouring ere its close, for the day of departure
is at hand, and to quit Glenalta is no
easy matter, I assure you. Poor Russell and
Annesley left us the day before yesterday. I
told you that I expected to be informed of
Charlotte's reply to certain questions which I
felt confident would be <i>put</i>; but I miscalculated:
however, silence tells <i>some</i> tales, it is
said, as well as language, and so in this case
I found it. It was plain to <i>my</i> eyes, and
others too amongst our party, that Russell
chose his opportunity while we were loitering
about the Glen, to make his proposals, which
were evidently met in a feeling not <i>sympathetic</i>: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
an increased <i>activity</i> of countenance told
me this. It would be injustice to call it anger,
but there was an expression of eye, and a
bright spot on each cheek-bone, that seemed
to indicate a very honest surprise, mingled
with what the peasants here comically call the
"least taste in life," of indignation. If I am
<i>right</i>, this is all in the strict <i>keeping</i> with Russell's
character. You and I long ago decreed
that he would never die of <i>love</i>, notwithstanding
all his enthusiasm about soft music. No; Russell
loves his <i>own</i> emotions better than the object
who excites them; and though I just feel
sufficient <i>esprit de corps</i> not in <i>general</i> to like an
individual of the other sex better for having
made one of our own look <i>foolish</i>, yet I am
sincerely glad that Charlotte has not accepted
our friend; first, because she would not be
happy if she married him, and secondly, because
I <i>do</i> think that just such a <i>hitch</i> will do
him good. He is a fine honest-hearted fellow,
and has a great deal of taste; but he surely
knows it rather too well, or at least he <i>shews</i>
that he does so, too much. Perhaps, more <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
truth-telling than his neighbours, <i>he</i> only expresses
what others have art enough to conceal.
You will say that I am catching infection,
and growing <i>acrid</i> in the society of old Bentley:
it may be so; but I tell you <i>all</i> my remarks.</p>

<p>Frederick and I got up to see the travellers
off at <i>cock-crow</i> on the morning of their departure,
and they left a blank which was felt
by us all. What a sweet contrast was presented
in this family with what I have so often
witnessed on similar occasions, when a gay
party had reached its <i>finale</i>, and was <i>crumbling</i>
away by twos and threes! I remember at
Featherston, when the last shooting-match
broke up in Autumn, Lady Frances and
Giorgina Lightfoot, who had been just saying
"<i>adio</i>" in the most melting accents to a <i>brace</i>
of departing guests (by the bye, the very Russell
of whom we were speaking was one of them)
called to Gifford and me in the moment after the
post-boy cracked his whip and the horses had
turned from the hall door, to accompany them
back to the breakfast-parlour. We obeyed; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
and the ladies, drawing their chairs close to
the fender, and desiring us to do the same,
Lady Fanny said, "For goodness' sake, come,
let us talk over those two creatures, and <i>cut
them up cosily</i>&mdash;I dote on a good <i>cosé</i> when
people have turned their backs; don't you?"
To <i>laugh</i> was all that one had for it; but the
feeling that Gifford and I were to be brought
under the <i>scalpel</i> of two such keen operators
as our fair hostesses proved themselves to be
anatomizing the <i>lately defunct</i>, glanced across
my mind, not certainly to the increase of ease or
benevolence.</p>

<p>How different at Glenalta! With talents
ten thousand times superior to those of the
Lightfoot sisterhood, and discrimination which
seems to grow in solitude, and preserve its
fineness of edge because it is not, like a school-boy's
penknife, employed to hack and hew at
every chair and table that comes in the way:
the truest hospitality protects all who go out
from under this happy roof; and all that is worthy,
pleasing, and amiable, is recollected, while
the <i>contraries</i> are held back in shade by that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
charity which <i>desires</i> their reform, and will not
render a change less probable by proclaiming to
mankind how much it is required. <i>Here</i> the
absent were talked of, and thought of, with
real kindness; and could they have taken a peep
amongst us from their first evening's halt, they
would have felt proud and gratified at seeing
the manner in which they were remembered.
Is there any thing so delightful as this feeling of
<i>security</i>? Charlotte was calm and unperturbed;
but I thought her more pensive than usual.
After breakfast we all appeared, without saying
so, as if inclined to pay a tribute to "the
friend that's awa," by not proposing any plan
for the morning; and it so happened, that
though not assembled by any agreement to
meet, we had all sauntered in pairs into the
wood, and all found ouselves dropping in two
and two at the Moss House, where we were
at length seated together, moralizing in concert,
rather sorrowfully upon meetings and partings,
when that very diverting compound, Mr. Bentley,
followed by George, joined our party.
He cannot resist the attraction of Mrs. Fitzroy's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
society, and I have found out in what consists
the great difference (dearly as they love
each other) between her character and that
of my aunt: it is this,&mdash;Aunt Douglas is drawn
by sympathy, Mrs. Fitzroy stimulated by opposition.
The former lives more in a region
of feeling, though one in which intellect too
is continually busy. The latter, though very
affectionate, can exist for a long time without
applying to the stores of her heart; and
provided you give her plenty of brains, she will
feed upon them, and keep her affections like
the furniture of a state drawing-room, with
the <i>covers on</i>. <i>Par consequence</i>, then, Mrs.
Fitzroy delights in seeing Mr. Bentley come
to pay a visit, and always rouses to the combat
which is sure to ensue, certain that her antagonist
is strong, and feeling that "wit
sparkles in collision."</p>

<p>"Good morrow, good people," said our
rough diamond, "I thought you would be all
as low as 'gib cats' this morning, after the departure
of those two <i>swains</i>, (casting a sidelong
glance at Charlotte, which she caught, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
and blushed immoderately,) and so I thought
it might divert you all, and adorn a page of
Madam Fitzroy's Anthologia Hibernia, to bring
you a pretty specimen of Irish impudence
which I have had to provoke me to-day.
You must know, that while I was playing the
fool, and strolling about at Killarney instead of
minding my business at home, a dozen of very
fine geese were stolen from my farm-yard, by
some of those sweet primitive sentimentalists
whom the fair flatterer there has decked in
such fanciful tissues, that when sent forth from
the dressing-room of her imagination, nobody
knows who they are. Well, I took proper
steps to trace the thief, and have put the
neighbourhood into a deuce of a fright; but
what do you think of the impertinence of
some funny dog (and here he laughed heartily
as he drew out from his waistcoat-pocket a
dirty scrap of paper) who sent my large gander
<i>twaddling</i> home this morning by himself, making
such plaguy noise that all the servants ran
together to see what was the matter; I found
this novel species of carrier-bird with a small <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
bag tied round his neck, containing a bright
new shilling, and the following ingenious
sample of poetry, after something of the leonine
fashion. He then unfolded at arm's length, the
crumpled composition, and read,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">
<div class="line">"Squire, dear, I live here,</div>
<div class="line indent">And you live <i>yander</i>;</div>
<div class="line">I bought your geese, for pence a-piece,</div>
<div class="line indent">The money I send by the gander."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We were indeed cheated out of our philosophy,
and set laughing most comfortably by the
ridiculousness of this adventure of neighbour
Bentley, which, as he anticipated, was seized
upon with rapture by Mrs. Fitzroy, for her
"Irish Reminiscences," but poor Charlotte
was writhing under the remembrance of her
having <i>blushed</i>, and Mrs. Fitzroy, who is very
good-natured, and who saw exactly the cause,
which was no other than that of having been
<i>suspected</i> to feel what in reality she did <i>not</i> feel,
endeavoured to relieve her by recurring to the
subject of our conversation, saying, "Oh!
Charlotte, you must repeat your last observation,
I scarcely heard it. Were you not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
saying that in wild places where there is no
great choice of society, the bonds of fellowship
are drawn closer, and people are disposed
to like each other better than in situations
which render one fastidious by the variety
they present? If <i>that</i>, my dear, was
your remark, I think it a very just one, and I
believe that I may apply the rule to our young
friends who are gone to-day; one of whom, had
I met him in what is called the <i>world</i>, I should
probably never have known, he is so reserved:
and the other is so volatile, that he would have
been completely evaporated over a larger surface."</p>

<p>Charlotte, who had quite recovered her
<i>nerve</i>, answered with perfect ease, "Well,
there is great pleasure in liking our fellow-creatures,
and, if retirement produce philanthropy,
it is better than the world; is it not?"
"I believe," answered Mrs. Fitzroy, that I shall
be entirely of your opinion some time or other,
though we arrive at this agreement by very opposite
paths. <i>You</i>, having seen nothing of the
world, and <i>I</i> a great deal too much of it; you <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
inhabitants of Glenalta are making me long for
settlement amongst you; and I feel as if you
were the only set of people living</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">
<div class="line">"Whose hearts keep the promise I had from the face."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Old Bentley <i>fidgeted</i>; giving one of his rapid
glances at George, to ascertain how he stood
<i>affected</i> by Mrs. Fitzroy's panegyric, and finding
"pleased acquiescence" seated on his nephew's
countenance, suddenly clapped his hands
on his knees (a favourite movement of his) and
exclaimed, "Pooh, madam! all fal lal sort of
talk. You might sit here till doomsday ringing
the changes upon these matters of sentiment,
and <i>all</i> be right and <i>all</i> be wrong. I
dare say that Miss Douglas could say something
different from what you and her sister
think upon the subject. Miss Fanny, if we call
her from tying up those sweet peas, would probably
tell us something else; and our young gentlemen,
all, I dare say, could produce a different
reading of the self-same thought. The fact is,
that each individual character gives its own
hue to such sort of disquisitions. Miss Douglas <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
what do you say?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Bentley, I believe that I do
think differently from Mrs. Fitzroy and Charlotte
on this occasion, and so I dare say that I
am wrong; but it strikes me that the more retired
the situation in which we live, the more
nice do we grow, and the more necessary do we
find <i>great</i> congeniality in the people with whom
we associate; <i>that</i> is if we want to love them. In
the world where every variety of talent and disposition
is to be found, one can choose, and if
disappointed in one instance, try in another;
but in retreat, we must make the best of the
given ingredients."</p>

<p>Bentley chuckled with delight, and rubbed
his hands in triumph. This keen observer
knew that Emily's opinion would justify his assertion,
and moreover that it would be favourable
to his views of keeping George's hopes, <i>if
he has any</i>, down to the ground, Emily being
the person, towards whom I suspect that he
thinks his nephew's half averted eyes, are directed.</p>

<p>"Aye, there it is," said the uncle, "all right, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
all wrong; exactly as I said. Mrs. Fitzroy is
social in all her tendencies. Human nature is
the book in which she principally delights to
study. Her love even of fine scenery is coupled
with society. She does not like any thing
much, except with a reference to communicating
her ideas, and puts me continually in mind
of a passage that I have met with in the works
of Balsac, an old French author, who says,
"Que la solitude est un belle chose, mais qu'il
est agréable d'avoir quelque un qui sache répondre,
a qui on puisse <i>dire</i> que la solitude est
une belle chose." Now another thing is, that
Mrs. Fitzroy does not require coincidence so
much as intelligence. Her mind is generally
in search of a good whetstone, while Miss Douglas&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Oh, do not paint me, Mr. Bentley," said
Emily, "I should fly from a portrait of myself."</p>

<p>"And I," said Mrs. Fitzroy, "declare loudly
against Mr. Bentley's rough sketches. I will,
however, admit that there is <i>some</i> truth in what
he says, and it exceedingly amuses me to catch <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
glimpses of his caricatures, though they would
terrify if I looked long at them."</p>

<p>"That is because my caps fit," answered our
Diogenes.</p>

<p>"Your caps are so ugly that no one would
<i>try them on</i>," replied Mrs. Fitzroy. "Mr. Otway
is <i>my</i> milliner, and to prove that I do not
wish to hoist false colours, I here pledge myself
to let you all see, if you like it, whatever our
friend of Lisfarne brings me this day, as answer
of a question, which I proposed to him yesterday
evening, while we were walking, and talking,
on this very subject. I then made a
complaint and told him that it has been my
fate most unjustly, and most painfully to my
feelings, to be thought insincere, though I know
to a positive certainty, that I err on the other
side and speak the truth with less reserve than
is prudent. I told Mr. Otway, for whom I entertain
the highest regard and admiration, that
his <i>review</i> of my character might be very useful,
if, as I am, alas! on the wing, he would give me
an explanation of what seems so extra-ordinary
to myself, in comparing causes with effects; and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
though I shall not be paid any compliments, I
am so sure of not being made worse than I am,
that, as I said before, whatever picture I receive
of myself from Lisfarne you shall certainly
see."</p>

<p>"Come, madam," said old Bentley, "the
coroner's inquest will be called immediately to
try the matter, and judge whether you are <i>murdered</i>
or not, for here is Mr. Otway. I see him
through the acacias, walking this way with Mrs.
Douglas."</p>

<p>"Then I will go and meet them," answered
Mrs. Fitzroy. "Frederick, you shall go with
me. I will ask for the paper which I expect,
and you shall bring it back to be read here before
I look at it myself, but I cannot stay like
a culprit at the bar, while you are all scanning
me according to evidence."</p>

<p>So saying, she gaily hastened away, joined my
aunt, and sent back with the following account
of herself from the pen of Mr. Otway:</p>

<p><i>Answer to Augusta's Question.</i></p>

<p> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Augusta inquires why she, who never feels
conscious of desiring to deceive, should be
reckoned insincere by those who do not understand
her; and as this comprehends by far the
largest portion of the people with whom she
converses, how it is that the general voice of
mankind, which is usually considered to convey
the truth with respect to individual character,
is in her case a false criterion, representing her
as the opposite of what she really is? I think
that I can solve the enigma satisfactorily. Augusta
is a woman of decided genius, a word
which comprehends the union of fine talent, and
quick perception. She also possesses that force
of understanding which has been commonly,
though not correctly distinguished by the epithet
masculine, she herself furnishing proof that
we of the other sex have no right to the <i>monopoly</i>
which we often assume; and that, in seizing
on the <i>copy-right</i> of solid sense, we are guilty of
an untenable usurpation. Augusta is particularly
qualified to appreciate merit, for her mind
is penetrating and her taste refined; but <i>enthusiasm</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
is the blind that interposes to prevent the
exercise of her judgment. Eager to find materials
on which to employ her intellect and affections,
and ever in search of objects that may
prove worthy of exciting them; her progress
through life has been one continued voyage of
discovery. She dislikes the common track, and
avoids those ports where low traffic and vulgar
merchandise are all the allurement that presents
itself. She delights in setting her sails for some
<i>terra incognita</i>; and in the true spirit of an
animated adventurer, if on landing she find a
few grains of gold in the sands, she imagines
rich mines in the distance, and precipitately announcing
the Eldorada of her hopes, hastens
forward to secure the treasure in prospect.
Delusion has too frequently mocked her career:
not that Augusta invented a fiction; she had
found the grains of precious metal, and fancied
that it was only to follow the course of the
stream, and be rewarded with store of riches;
but in ascending the current no glittering prize
repays her toil. Rugged mountains, barren
rocks, and tedious flats, fatigue the eye; returning <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
weary and disappointed, she trims her bark
and invokes a favourable breeze, and bidding
adieu to the region which had exhibited poverty
instead of wealth, she weighs anchor and steers
for another coast. Under this allegory would
I present Augusta a mirror in which to behold
herself. Tired of the vapid circle by which
she has been encompassed in the world, and
weary of crowds in which she found little congenial
society, she has been perpetually engaged
in seeking for what might interest her better
feelings, and fill the vacuum which she experienced
in her mind. In this pursuit it has frequently
occurred that some agreeable quality
met her view, and encouraged the activity of her
research; but, mistaking her own energy of anticipation
for success, she proclaims with joy,
the <i>treasure trove</i>, ere she knows the extent of
its value, and from impetuosity of gratitude, is
condemned to the humiliating confession that
the single attribute which she admired is not
associated with others which her own enthusiasm
had supplied, but lies, like the grain of
gold upon the surface of the sand, in solitary <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
insulation.</p>

<p>The apparent contrariety then, it would seem,
which has obtained a character of caprice for
Augusta, is produced by the very excess of that
quality which it is denied that she possesses, and
results from a superabundance rather than a deficiency
of sincerity. She speaks nothing but
the truth, when she praises prematurely, and as
honestly condemns when she discovers that her
panegyric was misapplied. I venture to predict
the operation of a new process in Augusta's
mind, which if I do not greatly mistake, has
been gradually awakening of late to a sense of
the only <i>true</i> estimate. She will never, here-after,
be satisfied I think with tracing character
<i>downwards</i> from some light ornamental decoration
at the <i>top</i>; but in future only expect that
those wreaths which adorn the capital shall be
firmly supported when the pillar rises from a
broad base of solidly established foundation.
The fire of a vivid imagination has prolonged
the <i>youth</i> of Augusta, and it is only now that
she is beginning to learn a valuable lesson in
morals, namely, that happiness, like liberty, is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
often overlooked in the search after it. Young
people, through inexperience, and sometimes
those who are older from sanguineness of temperament,
expect more from life than it has to
bestow. They consider happiness as a precious
jewel never hitherto possessed, yet certainly to
be found though in what shape, place, or circumstances,
it never occurs to them to define;
it is with them a sort of vague ideal charm,
always to be pursued, and as constantly eluding
the grasp. Liberty in like manner, with the
same description of persons, does not consist in
the absence of restraint; in the rational enjoyment
of property, or preservation of rights.
It is a loose ungovernable spirit of infringement
on the privileges of others. The mere security
derived under a just and equal administration of
the laws is no better than bondage in the eyes
of what are technically known by the name and
style of "radical reformers." All this is flat and
tame; they must <i>kick</i> and <i>fling</i>, to be assured
that they are not confined; they must be permitted
to do that which has neither reference to
pleasure nor utility, merely to exercise the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
<i>power</i> which absolute freedom bestows, just as a
child in a garden lays about him, and batters
down the flowers on each side with the stick in
his hand, without any need of, or desire for,
the things thus destroyed. We deceive ourselves
much in supposing that happiness of
mind any more than health of body depends
upon <i>place</i>. I do not say that change of scene
is not often both agreeable and convenient; but
if the heart be oppressed, or there be 'a thorn
in the flesh,' the <i>Mordecai</i> travels with us. We
cannot run away from ourselves. To be happy
in the limited sense which Providence permits,
let us endeavour to make <i>home</i> the centre of our
enjoyments. The fulfilment of those little
duties which are at every moment presenting
their claims, may be thought by many a strange
<i>receipt</i> for contentment; yet it is a very sure
one, and if there ever was an axiom on the
truth of which we may rely, it is, that "the mind
is its own place." Instead of looking to new
faces, and seeking in new situations for that undiscovered
<i>something</i>, we know not what, which
upon approaching will, like the sailor's "Cape <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
fly away," always vanish, or recede from our
view; let us be assured that, in every condition
of life, and in every spot of earth, much may
be done with the materials that lie immediately
around us; and if we evince no skill in the
manufacture of these, we should not turn a
wider range to profit. My dear friend Augusta
begins to feel these truths, and when they come
to be steadily acted upon, she will no more
be a prey to disappointment&mdash;no more be
accounted insincere. Her judgments will be
slower, and therefore less apt to err; her friends
will be fewer, and chosen not for their brilliancy
so much as their worth, and Augusta will find
that all the blessings which do not mock our
grasp, are to be possessed <i>every where</i>, if sought
upon the only principles which can never deceive."</p>

<p>"Excellent sense," exclaimed Bentley, "my
opinions are not expressed in such courtly phrase
as my friend Otway uses; but I agree in the
substance of every syllable that he has written.
He is quite right, but, like the prophet who
ordered a dip into the river Jordan to cure the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
leprosy, your moral physicians who prescribe
simples which are to be met with in the field of
our own minds, will never be attended to. No,
no, we must ransack the remotest ends of the
earth for our remedies, because no one is inclined
to think his own case a common one.
Mrs. Fitzroy returned at this moment with
<i>another</i> paper in her hand, over which she was
laughing heartily. "Oh come," said she, "and
read a most delightful copy of verses written
impromptu this moment for me by 'poet Connor,'
who, it appears, having missed us at Killarney,
stepped across the country to Glenalta,
that he might do honour in due form to the
strangers. Arthur, he is inquiring for you, and
as he is one of the most grotesque figures I ever
saw, I pray that you may look at him."</p>

<p>I went in quest of the poet, as I was desired,
and you may form some idea of these Irish
<i>improvisatori</i> by the few commencing lines of
Connor's composition in praise of Mrs. Fitzroy,
which, if you <i>admire</i>, shall be preserved with
their "<i>tail on</i>," along with his eulogy on your
humble servant, for a future day. What think <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
you of the following invocation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">
<div class="line">"<i>Egregious</i> Dame! thine ear benignly bend,</div>
<div class="line">And to the Muse of Kerry kindly lend</div>
<div class="line">Attention meet, while he shall aptly sing,</div>
<div class="line">And from Apollo's lyre soft music bring.</div>
<div class="line">The <i>ægis</i> of thy sweet protection grant,</div>
<div class="line">While to thy praise he tunes harmonious chaunt.</div>
<div class="line">Glory of England! here we gladly see,</div>
<div class="line">Renowned epitome arrived in thee.</div>
<div class="line indent10">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The rude figure who met my eyes on gaining
the house, gave a finish to the poetical treat;
and, certainly, in all my travels I have never
seen a person less formed by nature or art to
captivate <i>the nine</i>, than this votary of the Castalian
choir. He is a man of about sixty, of
Bardolphian physiognomy, who, I rather imagine,
is much more frequently indebted for the
fire of inspiration to a glass of whiskey, than to
the fountain of Helicon. A large, battered tin
snuff-box also contributed its aid to enliven
those numbers</p>

<p>
"Which warm from the still, and faithful to its fires,"
</p>

<p>were dealt out with equal readiness and prodigality
to all who looked as if they were inclined to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
purchase Parnassian fame; and the same snuff-box
supplied a substitute for sand, with which
ever and anon, the bard sprinkled his effusions.
Fancy a large, obtuse red face, curled head,
rough coat, of dark brown cloth, fastened with
a cord round his waist; a hat full of holes, an
ink bottle cased over with a <i>surtout</i> of pack-thread,
and tied at a button-hole; a pen stuck
behind one ear, and a roll of the coarsest description
of paper sticking out of his bosom,
and you have before you as much of poet Connor
as I shall give till you see his fac simile
admirably sketched by Fanny's pencil in my
journal. Mrs. Fitzroy and I, whose perfections
had been "theme of song," gave half a crown
each to the verse-vender, and received another
scolding from old Bentley for encouraging these
idlers, who, he says, truly enough I believe,
are amongst the most worthless part of the
community. We then dispersed, and went our
several ways, for the first time since the "<i>English
foreigners</i>" had been at Glenalta without saying
when shall we meet again? I am melancholy I
confess. My heart is full, as the hour of my <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
departure advances. The last week has brought
me more intimately acquainted than ever with
the excellence from which I must tear myself;
and I am sorrowful in proportion as I compare
the feelings which I brought to Ireland with
those which now on the eve of separation over-whelm
me, as I bid farewell to this happy
abode of all that is best and brightest. Where
shall I look for such affection; where seek such
disinterested kindness, mental improvement,
and variety of pleasurable excitement, as I have
found in this charming spot, which I nicknamed
Blue-stocking Hall, and believed to be a centre
in which pedantry, dullness, affectation, and
presumption, had agreed to meet and lodge
together?</p>

<p>Glenalta, "I cry you mercy;" if repentance
merit pardon, I may hope to be forgiven. I
love even Domine, and down to the very dogs,
nothing is an object of indifference that I leave
behind. How painful the sensation that one
experiences when the heart swells as though it
would burst its confine, an unbidden tear starts,
and utterance is palsied? Yet this is what we <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
pay our money for, and delight in the actor or
the actress who can most powerfully call forth
such emotion, by only imitating those passions,
and feigning those incidents which <i>naturally</i>
affect our sympathies. Why do we thus liberally
bestow our best feelings on theatrical fiction,
while we so frequently withhold them from
the legitimate claims of reality? Old Bentley
would give some reason, I dare say, for this
anomaly, not very favourable to human nature;
and if I think of it I will ask him the question
before I go. We are to have strangers at dinner
to-day, which is a <i>bore</i>, but my aunt wishes
to repay some of the many attentions shewn to
Frederick, since his return from Dublin, by all
the neighbouring gentry, who have been profuse
of congratulation, and perhaps she is desirous
of <i>constraining</i> us all to be more cheerful
in spite of ourselves, than the prospect of a parting
scene on the day after to-morrow would
permit, were it not for a little gentle compulsion.
I shall go on writing till we set out, and
shall not finish this till I reach London, where
I shall hope to find means of sending my packet <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
as <i>usual</i> by private hand. What a lucky dog you
are in receiving such <i>pounds</i> of stationery free of
cost, in a country where epistolary taxation is
calculated by weight? Adieu, till to-morrow.</p>

<p>Well, yesterday is "numbered with the years
before the flood," and the company which,
while in perspective, I thought would be a
<i>gène</i>, turned out a resource, and gave us a great
deal to talk of when spirits were flagging, and
threatened to fail unless given fresh motion by
some new <i>impingement</i> from without. The
ladies who were asked did not come, and
the most prominent features among the gentlemen
of the country who made their appearance
were, Mr. Fitzallan, a man of large
fortune, generally an absentee, and Mr. Ridley,
another person of good estate, together
with their respective sons. The politics, manners,
and sentiments, in every possible department
of conversation between these neighbours
are north and south of each other, but as they
met <i>here</i> on neutral ground, and in a <i>lady's</i>
house, all was smooth to outward seeming. Mr.
Fitzallan is a <i>liberal</i>, and very eloquent; he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
talked admirably on the rights of the people,
the errors of Administration, the total want of
honesty in Ministers; the shameful abuse of
power, peculation in every quarter, prostitution
of the national purse, and dereliction of
justice. He sat next to Mrs. Fitzroy, whose
animated countenance almost emitted <i>light</i>, as
she listened to a flow of mind so congenial with
her own. Mr. Ridley, on the opposite side,
who took his seat next my aunt, supported even
the very thickest skull to be found on the Ministerial
side of Lords and Commons. To a
person not immediately engaged in conversation
with either of our <i>leaders</i>, nothing could be
more comical than the effect of opposition in
the chance-medley of sounds that vibrated
round the table. It was what the printers call
<i>a pie</i>, when the <i>devils</i> have jumbled their types
into confusion. I heard liberty, authority,
equal rights, wholesome rule, universal suffrage,
Kingly prerogatives, emancipation, Protestant
ascendancy, the curse of tithes, the blessings
of an Established Church, &amp;c. in the drollest
<i>mess</i> that could be imagined. When the speakers <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
descended from their stilts, and, quitting the
arena of dispute on public affairs, <i>meandered</i>
into the paths of private life, the same remarkable
difference was observable in the style of
our orators. Mr. Fitzallan talked with enthusiasm
of the peasantry of Ireland as the finest,
but most oppressed, people under Heaven; declaring
that West Indian slavery had nothing
to compare, in its horrors, with the subjugation
of this British island; this land of beauty, this
nursery of the brave. He told some striking
anecdotes of his own tenantry, who, he said,
would follow him to the confines of earth, and
that were he like Roderick Dhü, only to whistle
as he rode along, the whole country would
rise in his defence. When he spoke of his
family, he dwelt on the lovely innocence of
childhood, and said how hard he felt it even to
<i>look</i> angrily. All <i>discipline</i> he left entirely to
Mrs. Fitzallan, who was, he acknowledged, so
much wiser than himself, that he willingly relinquished
every title to controul, and gladly
confessed that he was <i>hen-pecked</i> and <i>chicken-pecked</i>,
and <i>pecked</i> in every possible manner of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
<i>pecking</i>; adding, "I live, in fact, totally under
petticoat government, and find nothing suits
with my temper so pleasantly as to be led in all
things by my wife." Mr. Fitzallan's appearance
is very handsome, and his manners are
perfectly polished, which gave the most finished,
at the same time the most playful tone to every
thing he said, while Ridley looked as serious
in describing a game of German tactics to
Fanny, as if he had been delivering evidence
before a Committee of the House of Commons
on the Corn Laws. Young Fitzallan gave a
scowling glance at his father every time that he
spoke; and whenever he could slide in a word,
it was sure to be a <i>cut</i> at the difference between
theory and practice. Young Ridley, on the
contrary, seemed to hang with delight on every
word that his father uttered, though with the
most perfect freedom and considerable intelligence,
he sometimes ventured a flight in praise
of some of our Opposition men, who met with
no quarter from the old man. When the party
broke up in the evening Mrs. Fitzroy burst
into a glowing eulogium on Mr. Fitzallan, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
"who," she said, "was the most noble creature
she had met for ages. That man has such
heart, he is overflowing with love for his species,
and his views upon every subject are so
generous, so exalted, so comprehensive"&mdash;</p>

<p>"That they comprehend <i>nothing</i>, madam,"
interrupted Mr. Bentley in a high state of irritation.
"I repeat, madam," continued he,
"that you were never so mistaken in the course
of your life. This shewy man, who has attracted
so much of your admiration, possesses property
to a large amount in several counties in
Ireland. The agent whom he employs in this
part of the country, I know to be one of the
most grinding, heartless, fellows in creation.
Mr. Fitzallan is one of the worst landlords in
Ireland, and never does an act that is not dictated
by the grossest self-interest. In private
life he is a compound of pride and laxity. The
former governs his conduct with wife and children,
to all of whom he behaves in the most
imperious yet capricious manner; and, <i>though</i>
he has too little controul over <i>himself</i> to enforce
subordination in <i>others</i>, he is selfish and tyrannical <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
with all whose actions he can dare to command.
You might have observed how small a degree
of credit he has with his son, who dotes on
his mother, and resents, as far as he can, his
father's neglect of her. Madam, Mr. Fitzallan
fastened on your ear because you were a stranger,
and he found that he could play off an artillery
of <i>words</i> upon your ignorance of his true character.</p>

<p>"Now there is honest Jack Ridley, whom you
did not condescend to address, I believe, for the
whole day; I would bet a sovereign that you
think every syllable of what I have told you
fits him to a <i>tee</i>, and that I am either an idiot or
a madman for having given you such an account
of your favourite. The <i>truth</i> is, that you and
I may exchange our portraits, and each will
then possess a good likeness, for my worthy
friend Jack is all that you ascribe to Mr.
Fitzallan. If he incline perhaps a little to what
is <i>now</i> called bigotry, it is in defence of his
King and his Church, though he would not hurt
the feelings of <i>any</i> man, whatever be his creed.
He is an excellent magistrate, one of the best <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
of landlords, and it is worth going from this to
Fort Ridley to see him in the midst of his
family. When he returns to-night, the smile
of welcome will greet his arrival. His son and
he are probably at this moment cheerfully discussing
in their way home the agreeable party
at Glenalta; and will make the fire-side group
partakers in every little incident or remark
that has occurred during the absence of two of
its members.</p>

<p>"Were we to accompany the Fitzallans in
<i>their</i> homeward course, I promise you that
your enthusiasm would be plunged in an ice-bath
ere you had left this gate three perches behind
you. Imagine the father and son, fitted
like corner-cupboards into the extreme angles
of their carriage, asleep, or feigning sleep; knees
approximating, but not <i>touching</i>, towards the
centre. Arrived at the <i>Rialta</i> (foolish name),
the gentlemen contrive to separate without a
mutual "good night,"&mdash;no "blazing hearth,"
no "crackling fagot;" no beaming open countenance
awaits their return. A silence dark
and chill as death pervades the mansion, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
morning's sunny ray has no power over the
gloomy hearts that dwell within it. At the
Rialta absenteeism stares you in the face
whichever way you turn. Offices dilapidated,
plantations overgrown, gates off their hinges,
walls scolloped into gaps, weeds flourishing in
the very porch, paper hanging about your
ears, bell-ropes pulled down from their cranks,
furniture thinly scattered, old fashioned, yet
ill preserved, heavy, but not magnificent: these
are the dreary indications of approach to the residence
of a popular orator, who lives beyond
his means, and comes annually amongst his
tenants to obtain supplies which may enable
him to pass another year in estrangement from
their wants and their wishes.</p>

<p>"At Fort Ridley you find tight cottages, whole
fences, trim gardens, clean walks, and warm
welcome. You hear no cant about a radical
reform; but you see progressive and constant
improvement. Your ears are not assailed by
cataracts of fine words, but your heart acknowledges
a continued flow of kindness and
good humour. You encounter no tirades about <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
liberty and equality, but you find all happy
in their <i>own places</i>. Parents walking hand-in-hand,
sustaining each other's authority, not
struggling for their own: children respectful
and affectionate: servants orderly and comfortable:
the poor protected: the unhappy consoled.
Mrs. Fitzroy, I only say, give me one
Ridley, man, woman, or child, and I will joyfully
contract to let you have as many Fitzallans
as you can steam away from us in your
packet. Take an old man's assurance, that
there is little <i>reality</i>, whenever you find much
<i>shew</i>. Good wine (the proverb says) needs no
bush; and when people <i>do</i>, they need not <i>talk</i>.
Things tell their own stories. "Be not solitary,
be not idle," is the conclusion of Johnson's
beautiful fiction on the Search after Happiness;
and Voltaire, the very opposite of our
great moralist in all but the possession of superior
talent, finishes his disgusting, but witty,
<i>Candide</i>, with words to the same effect,
'<i>Il faut cultiver le jardin</i>.'"</p>

<p>"You always set your face against whatever
I approve," said Mrs. Fitzroy; "but Mr. Fitzallan <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
seems <i>quite</i> a practical man," added she,
"and that is the reason that I like him. All
his principles are pure; and, judging by what
I have seen, I should say they are reduced to
daily exercise, else how should he know so
much of the Irish peasantry, or be able to
relate so many interesting anecdotes respecting
them?"&mdash;"Why, madam," replied old Bentley,
"you might as well argue to the original
humour of a man who had learned Joe Miller
by heart. Mr. Fitzallan studies stage effect,
and has tragedy as well as comedy at his fingers'
ends. An Irish story, well purged from its yellow
clay, and dressed to advantage, is a nice
morsel, even in the heart of London, if you do
not stuff your friends with too much of a good
thing; and the gentleman of whom we are
speaking knows exactly how much pudding will
choke a dog."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzroy is so genuinely diverted by Mr.
Bentley, that they always part the best friends
imaginable. He now shook hands and went
home. When he was gone, Mr. Otway said
of him, "There goes one of the bluntest, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
yet the kindest, people I know. It would seem
as if Nature, in forming my worthy neighbour,
had been playing at hide-and-seek with herself;
for in his character there is a jumble of
the most heterogeneous materials: rude as a
bear, he is gentle as a lamb; and though sly
as a fox in detecting the wiles of his species, he
is one of the most single hearted persons I have
ever met with, in all his own dealings with
mankind. The penetration with which he
delves into character, is almost supernatural.
He decides on a counterfeit at a glance; and
though it is rarely his habit to indulge a sentimental
vein, you would be astonished by the
tenderness of feeling which sometimes softens
that rugged exterior. I know him so intimately
that I am aware of the contradictions in his
mind, and he is not ashamed of being <i>himself</i>
with me; but in common society he avoids the
least exhibition of softness, and is generally glad
when he has frightened strangers by his roughness,
though upon <i>occasion</i>, if he be in the <i>humour</i>,
I have known him delighted with individuals,
who, not repelled by his frown, have <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
braved opposition, and surmounted the obstacles
to his friendship.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fitzroy is a grand favourite, notwithstanding
<i>appearances</i>, and he told me to-day in
his own way of expressing sorrow for her departure,
that he expects to be like a fish out of
water when she bids farewell to Ireland."</p>

<p>The word farewell struck as a knell on every
heart: dear Phil. sighed, and wished us good night;
and ere we separated to reap the harvest of his
blessing, Mrs. Fitzroy, in a few words, but most
comprehensively summed up <i>his</i> character.&mdash;"Aye,"
said she, soliloquizing as he left the
room, "and there <i>you</i> go! the reviewer of reviews&mdash;the
critic of critics&mdash;possessing more of
every quality than you find to admire or value
in all the men of your acquaintance, yet bearing
your honours so meekly, with a mind so exquisitely
balanced, a temperament so calm, and
humility so lovely, that you allow anybody to
get before you and shine out his short-lived
triumph of display, while you in quiet majesty
pursue the equal tenor of your course, and,
like a mighty river, possessed between its banks, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
and full, 'though not o'erflowing,' wind onwards
to the sea."</p>

<p>I close my journal here, and shall not open
the portfolio which contains it till I awaken in
the unwonted scenery of Grosvenor Square.
Adieu, Glenalta! thou sweetest Glen adieu!
As I turn from this beloved spot I feel inclined
to exclaim, "Fate drop the curtain&mdash;I can lose
no more."</p>

<p>London!!! Oh, my dear Falkland, how
shall I take to my narrative, and resume
an occupation which <i>has been</i> so delightful,
but which loses its charm in this disgusting
round of idleness and dissipation? In any
other mood than that which I now am in, I
could dilate with melancholy pleasure on every
step of my journey. I could tell you that I felt
as if my heart would break when I lost sight
of the last mountain which is visible in the
distance from Glenalta. While I could gaze
upon its lofty peak, I felt as if some connecting
link still bound me to a place where all my
best affections were deposited; and when all
trace was lost of every object that continued <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
the illusion, I could not speak. The pang was
unutterable, and a thousand vague fancies
crowded over my mind, perplexing it "with
fear of change," and whispering unwelcome
thoughts that I should not revisit my Irish
home. There can be no <i>reason</i> for this, but
I find now by experience what I have <i>read of</i>
before, that low spirits enfeeble the understanding,
and make one start, though at nothing.</p>

<p>
"'Tis only the willows that wave in the wind."
</p>

<p>Yet the imagination conjures up phantoms of
ideal existence, and I worked myself into
such a dread of death, separation, misfortune,
and I know not what, that the turning of a
straw would have sent me back again, envious
of the very rocks that bent their faces towards
the happy valley which I left behind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzroy was a charming companion, for
she felt as I did; and we were neither of us inclined
to talk on any subject foreign to Glenalta.</p>

<p>I cannot give you a detail of our progress.
We reached Dublin, where the bustle of a new
scene obliged us to turn our thoughts from those
dear friends, whose society we missed so grievously <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
on the preceding day. We rested only one
night, and, after a calm passage of seven hours,
found ourselves at Holyhead.</p>

<p>Have you ever felt that as long as you are
<i>near</i> an object of attachment, the mind is restless
in the direct ratio of proximity, and, as you recede
from it, you become more satisfied, as it
would seem, from a feeling that every mile increases
the difficulty of contact, till impossibility
at length stares you in the face, and produces resignation
<i>per force</i>. Is not this the reason why
people who differ most widely from each other
in religion and politics are more tranquil, and
forbearing than such as are <i>all but</i> agreed?
The <i>little</i> difference, like the <i>mile</i> of separation,
seems to have no <i>right</i> to interpose a barrier,
and we are impatient accordingly that what appears
so easily surmountable does not give way
to our wishes. Mrs. Fitzroy and I, in the
course of our philosophizing, extended the same
principle to that disgust which is occasioned by
an attempt to carry imitation beyond a certain
limit. The painted statue is unpleasing, because
it assumes too much of similarity without <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
reaching identification; and we are nauseated
by the chattering of a monkey, who is <i>almost</i>
human, though we listen with pleasure to the
articulations of a parrot.</p>

<p>Having left my fair charge in Worcestershire,
at the house of one of her friends, I hastened to
town, and found every thing here in the confusion
attendant upon hurry. My poor mother,
dreading an <i>explosion</i> on my part, laid her plans
so as to circumvent me completely, and, on the
plea of my uncle's sudden illness, which gives us
reason to expect him by the very next ship from
Bengal, instead of at the distance of some
months, Adelaide's marriage has been <i>got up</i>
without any of the usual forms, which my mother
trusts to her own ingenuity and generalship
for having executed as well <i>after</i>, as <i>before</i>
the ceremony. Behold then, on my arrival, the
whole house turned topsy-turvy&mdash;servants in
new liveries flying to and fro, white and silver
favours glittering on their breasts, and the wedding
party just returned from St. George's Chapel.
I could hardly find a place to dress in,
nor a creature to do any thing for me. Having, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
however, caught a flying lacquey, I desired that
Louisa only should be informed of my arrival,
and she ran for five minutes to bid me welcome.
Whether agitated by my return, or forced into
disapprobation of the graceless contract which
had just been solemnized, I cannot tell, but she
flew into my arms with a burst of emotion which
I had never seen before, and which deeply affected
me. Louisa is formed for better things
than she lives amongst; but she has had no conductor.
Oh may I henceforward be truly a
brother! May I be enabled to cultivate her
tenderness, and obtain an influence over her understanding!
We agreed that I should be allowed
to repose in peace, and that the breakfast,
departure of the <i>nouveaux mariés</i>, <i>cake-cutting</i>,
and all the idle mummery of a bridal day, should
go on without me.</p>

<p>My sister returned to the banquet, and my
arrival was concealed from every body, till a
splendid travelling carriage drove off with Lord
and Lady Crayton, and all the <i>figurantes</i>, who
are brought together on these occasions to feed
the vanity of display, had dispersed. My mother <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
and Louisa joined the giddy throng, and
went to drive about the park, and exhibit the
hymeneal paraphernalia. I looked from a window
on the scene below, and sighed, as I thought
how differently a marriage would be conducted
at Glenalta.</p>

<p>With eyes opened to a new order of things,
I could not help musing heavily on what I saw.
A deaf man suddenly introduced for the first time
into the midst of a ball room would think the
people all mad, whom he beheld jumping about,
without being able to hear the inspiring sounds
which gave activity to the feet. Perhaps, had I
been engaged in this nuptial pageant, it would
have seemed, as it did to those who had parts
to act in it; but to me it appeared, from an upper
story of the house, the most senseless piece
of parade that I had ever witnessed, rendered
melancholy by anticipations of events which I
perceived in the vista of Adelaide's futurity.
Various analogies started to my mind. I recollected
the gay deception which precedes the
sacrifice, when a poor nun is about to relinquish
the natural enjoyments of life, and lay down <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
her hopes and affections on the altar of superstition.
I thought of her, when dressed in all
the trappings of this world's glory, she is led,
more frequently deceived than deceiving, to the
temple, there to resign her liberty and happiness,
perhaps her life, and become the sorrowing
victim of an ill-fated vow.</p>

<p>In the gloomy solitude of a large house, emptied
of its inhabitants, I had scope for much disagreeable
meditation, and wandered from room
to room, reflecting with sad foreboding, on what
is likely to be the lot of poor Adelaide, and ruminating
on the heavy expenses incurred by my
mother to seal a bond of misery. The furniture
of all our principal apartments is new and
sumptuous, of the last Parisian fashion, and
chosen with the best taste. The housekeeper
told me that a splendid new carriage had been
purchased, and that every thing connected with
this marriage had been done in the "best-possible
manner."</p>

<p>My mother and Louisa returned late, and
much fatigued. With the former I had but
little conversation. She met me with an air of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
great displeasure, and I fear that the only way by
which I can reinstate myself in her favour will
prove a destructive one. My property is already
burthened to a large amount, and to extricate my
mother I must plunge myself a great deal deeper
in debt. This must be done, however, as I will
use my best endeavours to set her mind at ease.</p>

<p>Poor Louisa and I sat up till morning, and,
though her mind is a complete chaos, she has
too much natural strength of character not to
perceive the folly, as well as meanness, of the
late arrangement, in which each side has been
trying to outwit the other. I find that the
Craytons set out directly after the ceremony for
Dover, and are on their route to the continent,
where their sojournment is to be regulated by
circumstances. "Pecuniary difficulties," though
not defined, are confessed to, <i>generally</i>, by my
new brother-in-law, who gives his title in the
hope of being paid for it in solid gold; and I
suspect that we shall find, ere long, how much
his creditors have been cajoled by an assurance
that between General Douglas and me, all their
demands will be satisfied. If the speculation of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
my uncle's assistance should fail, as much as the
hope of aid from me must necessarily do, I see
no prospect of aught but beggary for my unfortunate
sister.</p>

<p>Were we in the country, I should not despair
of operating a great change in Louisa's opinions;
but I have scarcely an opportunity of saying a
sentence to her in private. My mother does
not like to see us alone, and the interruptions
from company are incessant. I proposed going
to Selby, and should have found no difficulty in
prevailing, for in fact we are ridiculously out of
season <i>here</i>, but my uncle is certainly coming,
and so speedily, that he may land while I am
writing. All the people of <i>note</i> in town at present
are, Louisa tells me, brought together by
this marriage, which is flattering to those who
take pride in it; but, not being of that number
myself, I long to be set free, and when I <i>am</i>, no
time shall be lost in joining you as quickly as
possible. If I do not <i>soon</i> set out for Paris, you
shall hear again from, my dear Falkland,</p>

<h2>LETTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Pancras to Mr. Otway.</span></p>

<p class="right padding-right2"><i>Limner's Hotel.</i></p>
<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I am commissioned to notify the arrival in
England of your friend General Douglas, and
to inform you that in the present state of his
health, he feels himself incompetent to any manner
of exertion. He has been so ill on the voyage,
as to excite my constant apprehension lest
I might not enjoy the happiness of delivering up
my patient alive to his friends. He has been
somewhat better since we arrived in the Channel,
and I have no doubt that a little rest will be
of much benefit; but as he means to remain in
town for the arrival of another ship, which sailed
when we did, and on board which is a part of
his baggage, he will have the best medical advice
here, and proceed at leisure to Marsden, the
place which you were so good as to purchase for
him. The principal object of this letter is to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
entreat, that if not very inconvenient, you will
come over, and allow your friend the pleasure of
shaking you by the hand once more. He bids
me tell you, that he has much to say, and that
the power of communicating with you upon several
subjects near his heart, would contribute
more than any medicine to his recovery. May
it be permitted a stranger to enforce this request,
by adding his testimony to the General's own
conviction? It is not the physician who "can
minister unto a mind diseased;" it is the <i>friend</i>
alone who can sooth and sustain the sinking
spirits, and I look upon my patient as requiring
<i>your</i> advice as much as he does mine, though I
have had long knowledge of his complaints, and
have accompanied him from India. I will not
longer trespass on your attention than to request
an immediate answer, saying whether or not you
can comply with the entreaty of which I am the
medium.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">From Miss Douglas to Miss Sandford.</span></p>

<p>
My dearest Julia,
</p>

<p>It is some time since you have heard from
me, and in the interval much has happened to
disturb our even course of life. The departure of
our friends, particularly that of Arthur, produced
a degree of desolation at Glenalta, which can only
be understood by such as have felt the pangs of
separation from those they love. When <i>you</i>
left us, a similar chasm was made in our happiness,
but you could not comprehend our feelings,
though you were very sorry to say farewell.
You were <i>going</i>, we were <i>staying</i>, and supposing
the same measure of affection, there must be a
wide difference between the situation of a mind
presented continually with new objects that force
themselves on the observation, and one that is
bound in all the melancholy associations of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
scene which had witnessed its happiness. The
fresh air, the constant movement, the necessity
of speaking and interesting oneself in the details
of a journey, must save the heart much
bitterness, which is reserved for the saddened
spirits left behind. I never shall forget the
tomb-like silence that pervaded our cheerful
abode when the last sound of the carriage wheels,
that bore away dear Mrs. Fitzroy and Arthur,
were no longer to be heard. We <i>then</i> only
seemed to feel the full extent of our deprivation.</p>

<p>Charlotte and I, unable to occupy ourselves,
wandered like ghosts. Oh the emptiness of a
bedchamber from which your friend has just
departed! The pillow still bearing impress of
the head which had rested on it so recently;
the spikes of lavender scattered on the floor,
which, perhaps, you had gathered yourself in a
happier hour, to give fragrance to the now vacant
wardrobe; the back of a letter inscribed
with the name that now stops your utterance,
and the thousand other trifles, light as air, that
take affection by surprise, and make one wretched
through every fibre of the frame! Fanny's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
grief had quicker vent; she wept, till like a babe
that cries itself to sleep, nature <i>would</i> have rest;
and I envied her the power of listening with
rapture, to the history of some young cygnets,
which old Lawrence had got from Bantry as
a present for her. Frederick was sincerely sorrowful,
but he was obliged to attend to Mr. Oliphant,
and his mind was relieved by the necessity
of being employed.</p>

<p>The beloved mother who suffers more than
she enjoys society, always returns to the stillness
of retirement, glad to repose after exertion,
and rewarded by the happy feeling of having
practised self-denial in order to make others
happy.</p>

<p>Charlotte and I then were the <i>miserable</i> of
our little circle, and the kind Phil. accordingly
gave his principal attention to us. He insisted
on our being <i>busy</i>. He drove us to our gardens,
to our poor people, to the schools, all of
which had been less carefully watched, while
our friends were with us. How slow is the progress
of improvement. How rapid the growth
of whatever is baleful in its nature! We found <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
much to reclaim, and were ashamed, as well as
astonished to find how things may go astray, and
run to ruin, while one is only pursuing what
appears an innocent gratification. Well, it
shall not happen again. We have now restored
matters to their former good order, and
if we enjoy less <i>pleasure</i> than we did in the
midst of more varied attraction; I feel more
contentment and less self-reproach, since we
have resumed our accustomed course. I now
understand that of which it was so difficult to
convince me, namely, that <i>company</i>, however
delightful, is too stimulating for a continuance,
and that it is very wholesome to be left alone
now and then with one's own heart.</p>

<p>Letters (that blessed invention) have informed
us constantly of all that is interesting in
the lives and adventures of our absent friends;
but the last accounts from Arthur have distressed
mamma, and produced commotion in
our tranquil valley.</p>

<p>My poor uncle is in short arrived, and so ill
that his physician has written to beg Mr. Otway's
immediate presence in London. It is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
thought right that Frederick should accompany
him as a proper mark of respect, and also to
add weight to mamma's request, that should
our mild climate be considered advisable for
the invalid, he will repair as soon as possible to
Glenalta.</p>

<p>To lose Frederick and our friend of Lisfarne
at one and the same moment is a stroke which
needs some philosophy to endure; and I am
afraid that we are not bearing it as we ought to
do. Then I cannot help feeling sadly afraid of
uncle Douglas, who is, Arthur says, very <i>repellent</i>
in his manners. Poor man! he suffers
much, and it is unreasonable to expect that he
should be agreeable in his present circumstances;
but I am so accustomed to the sweet
accents of gentleness and affection, that nothing
terrifies me so much as the idea of severity. I
feel still more for mamma than for myself, and
as the general has apparently taken a dislike
already, Arthur tells us, to my aunt Howard
and Louisa, why should we expect better at the
hands of one, governed, perhaps, by prejudice
against all his family, with whom he has kept up <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
very little intercourse?</p>

<p>Mr. Otway and Frederick set out next week,
and but for the delight I have in the hope that
they will soon return, and the latter be happy
in his cousin's society, while he is enjoying his
first visit to London, I should be inconsolable.</p>

<p>We have had intelligence of Lord and Lady
Crayton's arrival in Rome, where young Stanhope
has seen them. Lord C. is fond of play,
and poor Adelaide Howard, I am afraid, is destined
to be any thing but blessed in her union
with him. What can induce people to make
the sacrifice of liberty and peace for the sake of
a paltry title? Perhaps I am careless about
such things only because I am placed in a situation
where they are of little value; but a coronet
seems of small estimation in my eyes, and I
wish that my cousin had a husband less extravagant
and more domestic, though plain Mr.
instead of Viscount, preceded his name. He
and Adelaide are to pass the winter in Paris.</p>

<p>You bid me to describe our late visitors. To
say that we found them a very agreeable addition
to our party, is saying nothing that will help <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
you to distinguish one from the other. Yet
beyond some such general description, what can
tell of strangers? If you delineate the features
of a landscape, you can speak not only of them
as they seem, but as they <i>are</i>; but what a
length of time is required to guard against misrepresentation
in painting the human character,
of which we can for a long while only know the
<i>signs</i>, but may remain in profound ignorance of
the motives which govern them!</p>

<p>You may remember how much I used to admire
Miss Talbot. I saw her frequently last
summer, when she looked so pretty, and was so
kind to me, that I became quite enthusiastic in
her praise; and should have been very foolish
about her, if mamma had not damped my
energy, by saying one day, "dearest Emily, do
not take so much for granted: wait to know
Miss Talbot better before you give her <i>all</i> your
heart." I felt that there must be good reason
for this reproof, or I should not have received
it. I paused, and ceasing to inflate my mind
with my own exaggerations, mistaking them for
realities, I <i>did</i> wait to know Miss Talbot better,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
and one <i>look</i>, though unaccompanied by a
word, darted at her father, who asked for a particular
song which she did not choose to sing,
levelled the whole edifice of my admiration to
the dust. The same song which she had refused
to a parent's request, she <i>volunteered</i> when Mr.
Mortimer Fitzallan came into the room, saying,
in her sweetest accents, and with her winning
smile, "I will now sing <i>your</i> favourite." To
return after a digression, which contains my
apology for not attempting to give you exact
portraits of our guests, I will proceed to say,
that as far as I am acquainted with them, I like
Mr. Annesley better than Mr. Russell, and <i>both</i>
pleased me, though not in the same manner.
The former is more gentle and reflecting than
his friend, the latter full of music and of merriment;
but one is not always merry, and if <i>not</i>,
Mr. Russell's animal spirits fatigue. Then, as
to music, I think that he likes it less for its own
sake, than as a subject on which to be eloquent.
Mr. Annesley <i>says</i> less, but <i>does</i> more than the
other, in the way of those little polite attentions
which mark a wish to please; and he looks so <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
sincere, that one feels always ready to <i>believe</i>
whatever he utters, while the wandering eye of
his companion would indicate that his thoughts
are every where, or no where, though his tongue
be employed in giving to them the liveliest expression.
Mr. Annesley's animation arises out
of the occasion, while Mr. Russell is ever intent
on <i>seeking</i> opportunity to exhibit <i>his</i>. In conversing
with the one, you find your spirits
refreshed by the natural alternation of stimulus
and repose. In talking to the other, you are
made to feel that a certain measure of excitement
is to be <i>run out</i>; after which, you must
lie by to recruit, ere you commence anew.
They are both polished, and have received all
the advantages of modern education, and thus
ends my story of them.</p>

<p>Mamma will write to dear Mrs. Sandford,
when she can tell her of <i>the general's</i> movements.
Have you ever remarked how many
people tack an emphatic <i>the</i> to any admiral,
general, colonel, dean, or archdeacon, accidentally
appended to their family, just as if there
were no other of each class in the world beside <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
their own? Adieu, dearest Julia: our united
loves to all at Checkley.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Frederick Douglas to his Mother.</span></p>

<p>
Beloved Mother,
</p>

<p>Our dear Phil. insisted on writing the first
letter from London, and as this point was settled
before we left Glenalta, you have not
charged me with neglect; forgetful I can never
be. You all live continually in my thoughts;
I fancy how you are all employed during every
part of the day, and never see any thing that
delights or surprises me, without wishing that
my mother and sisters were to enjoy whatever
is worthy of their admiration. This is to me a
scene of wonder, and I have a great deal of
trouble in suppressing too true an exhibition of
my rusticity, and curbing my astonishment at
things so common, that no one here could comprehend
my ignorance of them. London is a
world full of interest to a novice like myself, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
and while the charm of novelty lasts, and curiosity
is kept alive, I shall find as much happiness
as I can feel away from you; but the people
with whom I meet at my aunt Howard's, though
I am told that they are of the first circle, have
little merit, I must confess, in my eyes. I ought
however, to begin with the <i>hosts</i>, before I
describe the company. My aunt is as unlike
you, as Louisa is different from Emily, Charlotte,
or Fanny. The former is so rouged, so
dressed, and made up, that a natural emotion,
if any such live within her breast, has no power
to reach the surface. Every feature seems fixed,
as though she were a <i>cast</i>, and not a real human
form of flesh and blood. Her manners are so
cold, and her eye so disdainful, that had I come
to Grosvenor-square <i>alone</i>, one glance would
have been enough to settle my resolves not to
encounter a second; but she treats Arthur, her
only son, and <i>certainly</i> a favourite, as frigidly as
she behaves to me; and with her daughter,
there is a perpetual <i>sparring</i> kept up, which to
my unaccustomed ear is perfectly dreadful,
though at the same time, she is evidently vain <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
of Louisa's beauty and accomplishments. To
Mr. Otway she is <i>civil</i>, and towards my poor
uncle, <i>officious</i> to excess, without being <i>able</i> to
look kind. My cousin is very handsome, and if
she had been <i>your</i> child, would, I believe, have
been very amiable, for she is good-natured, in
spite of every effort to make her the contrary;
and her love for Arthur is genuine, I believe,
though of a species very new to me. Her person
is encumbered with ornaments, and her
mind with fashion. Her understanding is excellent,
and <i>will</i> break its bounds, and start forth
through all the London fogs that would obscure
its light; but it is only in accidental scintillations
that Louisa's brightness discovers itself,
and <i>then</i>, sarcasm is generally the medium
through which it shines; nothing can exceed
the stupid inanity of such conversation as I
hear at my aunt's, where <i>people</i> only are ever
discussed. It is one eternal round of dress,
public places, and gossip. <i>Every</i> body is said
to be out of town, yet the streets are full.
<i>Nobody</i> is ever in London at this season, yet
the Howards live in a crowd of society, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
would be very angry with <i>any</i> body who ventured
to affirm that their acquaintance is not
<i>first-rate</i>. Mr. Otway reconciles many apparent
incongruities through his explanations, when
we reach our lodgings at night, and I am already
bidding fair to part with the nick-name which
Louisa has bestowed upon me of the "novice
of Saint Patrick." My <i>Mentor</i> tells me, that
London is in fact, at this moment, full of
people who are ashamed of not being at their
country seats, the watering places, or on the
continent; and are detained here <i>malgrè</i> for
want of money to go elsewhere, or pay off the
bills which continue daily to increase, while they
remain in town, <i>shying</i> each other. It is true
that the people do not imprison themselves:
they meet in the streets, in the shops, in the
park, at the theatres; but there seems to be a
conventional agreement to tell lies, which are
permitted, like base metal, to circulate in the
place of sterling coin, though known to be
counterfeit by all who use it as a medium of
exchange. There is a sort of <i>sinister</i> honesty
in this compact, as deception is avoided in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
universality of the fraud. One family is detained
by Dr.&mdash;&mdash;, who will not suffer his patient
to undertake as yet a journey to Leamington.
Another is just <i>going</i> to France. A third
<i>waits</i> for a carriage which has been promised by
the coachmaker, but is not <i>quite</i> finished, and
so on. Not a word of truth in any of the
stories. A country bumpkin, however, benefits
by all this <i>charlatanerie</i>, and finds food for eyes,
ears, and reflection, at a time when the metropolis
ought to be according to the rules of <i>haut
ton</i>, a perfect desert.</p>

<p>The friendship of Arthur sets me at ease.
Were it not for him, I should sneak into a
corner I suppose, and not dare to utter a word
for fear of <i>committing</i> some Hibernicism, and
bring the eyes of Europe upon me; but, supported
by my faithful Achates, I am bold, and
you would perhaps be astonished to see me
<i>doing the agreeable</i> at my aunt's evening parties.
I assure you that I make my way surprisingly,
and am beginning to feel rather triumphant.
Louisa put me through a sort of ordeal which
was unpleasant enough for three or four days; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
but Arthur gave me a few hints behind the
scenes which enabled me to come off victorious,
and now like a <i>freshman</i> at school, who has
<i>boxed</i> himself into character, I am <i>let alone</i>,
and actually applied to, for my opinions upon
"Shakspeare, taste, and the musical glasses."
Some contrivance is necessary, however, to slide
out of a group when it happens that a cross
subject is started; but in general, I find myself
<i>au fait</i>, for a grain of intellect, like a grain of gold
will hammer out into surface enough to cover a
prodigious field of "worshipful society;" and if
you are quick in picking up names, admiring
the right music, the fashionable singer, the favourite
novel, and the <i>newest</i> of every thing,
you need not draw unmercifully on your brains,
nor put your eyes in danger of Opthalmia, by
poring over the midnight lamp. I fancy Emily
and Charlotte, with inquiring eyes, pressing
forward together, to ask Frederick whether his
soul has not been entranced by the finished performance
of our London <i>belles</i> on the harp and
piano-forte.</p>

<p>Dearest girls, publish it not in Gath, if I <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
whisper the homespun confession, and tell you
in depth of secrecy, that pleasure is a stranger
to me at our concerts. I hear compositions so
chromatic, modulations so unnatural, transitions
so violent, and harmony so entirely divested of
the character which I have been in the habit of
attaching to it, that, were it not for information
to the contrary, I should not be aware that I
was listening to music at all, but should imagine
myself introduced to a new and wonderful
mechanism for exhibiting the muscular powers
to their utmost extent, and also trying how far
it is practicable to exert the licence of caprice
without ever touching on the borders of melody.
In the same spirit of confidential avowal I may
add, that there seems to be a strict covenant between
the modern composers and the instrument-makers
to murder music, and prevent a
concerto, as well as the piano-forte on which it
is performed, from a longer existence in the
fashionable world than will be allotted to the
preposterous flat hats, which only require poles
supporting their circumference, to give the Regent's-park
exactly the air of an encampment. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Another musical observation which I have
made, is, that every young lady on first setting
down, and running over the keys of the finest
Stoddart or Broadwood, piped, barred, and
<i>dandified</i>, according to the very latest vogue,
declares the instrument to be out of tune.
Quere, is this to make boast of an exquisite ear,
or is it done to bespeak mercy for imperfect
execution? In either case, to produce <i>effect</i> it
should not be a <i>general</i> fashion; and there
should be at least a foundation of truth in the
complaint; but it literally happened yesterday
evening, that Louisa's magnificent instrument
had been put into the highest order only half
an hour before the company arrived, and yet the
fair competitors for fame were not a whit the better
satisfied. Perhaps after all it is necessary to
talk a little nonsense, and tumble over the leaves
of whatever music is open on the desk, to
gain time for shaking back the manacles which
load the wrists of a fashionable lady with such
<i>shekels</i> of gold that their weight is apt to determine
the blood towards her finger tops. This
is an inconvenience, and certainly an alloy to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
the pleasure of exhibiting richer ornaments than
were ever <i>à la mode</i> till now, but what advantage
is there without its counterpoise? It is
unlucky too that necklaces are <i>out</i>, as they afforded
great opportunity in perpetual fiddling
with them to regulate the <i>circulation</i>, and shew
off bracelets and rings in the best possible position
for securing white hands and arms, during
the time being.</p>

<p>Dearest mother, do I see you shake your
head, and call this ill nature? If I thought that
a shadow of displeasure glanced over that brow
on which I pray unceasingly that I may never
be the means of gathering a cloud, I would
make a vow against opening my eyes to the ridiculous
while I remain in London; but I hope
that even <i>you</i> will laugh with me at the absurdities
which we must be blind not to see, and
dumb not to tell of. If the sisters imagine that
my heart is likely to be perforated like a <i>cullender</i>,
tell them that not a single missile has
reached it as yet,</p>

<p>
"Th' invaders dart their jav'lins from afar."
</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I am safe, and likely to remain <i>unscathed</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
by any lightning from London eyes.
This is fortunate; for what chance would a
poor Kerry <i>bog-trotter</i> have of meeting "sweet
return" in this meridian blaze&mdash;this dazzling
glare?</p>

<p>I love our dear Glen better than any
scenery that I have met with since I left its
sunny lawns and tangled dells; and, if I may
be allowed to compare the moral with the physical
world, there is an enchanting refreshment
in the lights and shades of a refined yet <i>natural</i>
character, beyond all the glow of fashion's artificial
splendour to impart.</p>

<p>Last night I sat for a short time by a
young lady who had something pensive in
her countenance, which brought Emily to
my mind: and feeling a sort of <i>attraction</i>
towards her, I listened to her conversation,
in which, hearing some words through the
din of voices, that bespoke a love of painting
and sculpture, I determined on getting <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
<i>alongside</i>, as the sailors say. I did so, and we
talked of the Exhibition, the Elgin Marbles,
Sir Thomas Lawrence, Chauntry, Canova, &amp;c.
but <i>talk</i> it was, aye, "<i>vox et preterea nihil</i>."
Not a particle of enthusiasm had reached her
mind, it only flickered round her lips. She
had been in Rome, had seen Naples, visited
the Louvre, ransacked every <i>atelier</i> of every
celebrated artist in her travels; and, as a matter
of course, is come back discontented with every
thing in England. I sought as vainly for a
single grain of taste in her conversation as I
generally do for a strain of sweetness in the
music which I daily hear: no;&mdash;terms of art
and fashionable echoes met my ear, but not a
sentiment that originated in feeling: no description
drawn by a pencil dipped in the
heart.</p>

<p>I ventured to say something, I know not
what, but my remark was my own; I was not
to be found, I suppose, in the common-place
book acknowledged at present, as the reception
that it encountered was a rude burst of laughter,
in which my fair antagonist's mamma, who <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
came to present Lord Oldfield to her daughter,
joined immediately, and I should have been the
<i>butt</i> of the company, I conclude, if my happy
stars had not sent a nobleman to my rescue,
who so entirely engrossed the attention of both
mother and <i>ma'mselle</i>, that a <i>mouse</i> would
have been a greater object than I was. Otway's
lines rushed on my memory as I gazed indignantly
on this vulgar pair; for how can I give
them any more appropriate epithet? When I
looked around me, and rested my eyes on the
<i>wool-pack</i>, matrons lounging in their easy
chairs so large and languid, I could not help
mentally exclaiming,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">
<div class="line">"Those lazy owls, who, perched near Fortune's top,</div>
<div class="line">Sit only watchful with their heavy wings</div>
<div class="line">To cuff down new-fledged Virtues that would rise</div>
<div class="line">To nobler heights, and make the grove harmonious."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I suppose that the immense size of the elderly
ladies here, must proceed, from the little
exercise they take, and <i>that</i> little in a carriage
which is next to not taking any; but I am told
that it is the fashion to be <i>monstrous</i>, and if
beauty be reckoned by weight and measure, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
tonnage and poundage of London are prodigious.</p>

<p>When Lord Oldfield left my aunt's to
vapour at another party, the above-mentioned
young lady of pensive mien, seemed to recollect
that she had treated me somewhat cavalierly,
or perhaps she was amused by my <i>outlandish</i>
ways of thinking, and returned to look at me,
as people used to do at the Cherokee chiefs, or
Sandwich Islanders; but from whatever motive,
so it was, that she called me to her, and with a
smile of such <i>concentration</i> as appeared to say,
"<i>Sauve qui peut</i>," she invited me to attend her
to-day and look at some statues, at the house of
an Italian newly arrived. Now I had charity
enough to believe that she had only <i>heard</i> of
them as fine specimens of sculpture, and was ignorant
altogether of what she was going to see;
but before I could reply, she added that she had
begun to model from a Cupid in the collection,
and hoped that I should approve her performance.
Arthur and I had been to see these
statues two or three days ago, and all I can say
is, that as I have not yet had the advantage of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
<i>case-hardening</i> on the continent, I blushed as I
bowed a seeming assent, resolving to make my
excuse this morning, which I have accordingly
done.</p>

<p>If modesty be really one of those cumbrous
virtues, which, like the ponderous armour of
former days, is no longer necessary in the high
state of civilization to which we have attained,
why is not the word honestly banished along
with the quality which it represents? and why
do we foolishly retain the sign, if we must lose
sight of the idea to which it belongs? It would
be wrong, perhaps, to charge a modern fair one
with actual vice because she can walk with
perfect unconcern through files of statues
representing the human form in a state of
nudity, and <i>that</i> too in company, it may be, of a
profligate man; but I <i>must</i> say, that to my untutored
sense, the thing is very disgusting; and
as London is certainly not the Garden of Eden,
I should venture to add, that the practice is not
very safe, unless moral virtue be no longer considered
requisite to the well-being of the community,
but with other antiquities is to be only <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
reserved for the cabinets of the curious; <i>there</i>,
as we view it clothed in venerable rust, to
excite our astonishment at the difference between
the clumsy accoutrements of our ancestors,
and the convenient accommodations of our
own time.</p>

<p>I am interrupted by Mr. Otway, who sends
his love, and bids me say, that he has a letter
on the <i>anvil</i>; so I will send mine. But I have
been led into the mazes of this brilliant scene, so
far remote from <i>domestic</i> subjects, that I find
not a word in all my prosing of poor uncle,
for whom I feel both tenderness and respect.
He suffers much, and, if I am not greatly mistaken,
has "that within which passeth shew."
His mind appears to me as if it had gone out of
Nature's loom a goodly tissue, but has been
pulled <i>bias</i> by untoward circumstances of fortune
and ill health. As yet I know very little
of him, and he is so reserved with his relations,
that were there not certain loop-holes
through which I peep into the interior, and
thence form judgment of his true texture, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
first and second words of Cæsar's <i>triplicate</i>
would answer every purpose of description in
my instance; and in saying <i>veni vidi</i>, I should
tell you all that is to be known; but I sometimes
see him shake his head, and catch him
now and then, his eyes suffused with tears,
and fixed intently on me. The moment of
observation is that of change, and, as a person
who has dropped asleep in Church, coughs,
hems, and kicks his heels, to <i>prove</i> how much
awake he is, so my uncle throws a tartness,
an abruptness, into his manner after one of
these little affectionate <i>lapses</i>, to assure us of
the sternness of his character. My next shall
be to Emily.</p>

<p>Adieu, beloved! My heart is with you
all, though the <i>casket</i> be far from you.
I shall have much to tell the three, <i>Graces</i>
I <i>will</i> not call them, Furies I <i>cannot</i> call them:
what then <i>shall</i> I call them? They shall be
the <i>Destinies</i>, because my fate is in their hands,
and as they love and value me through life,
I shall be happy or the contrary.</p>

<p>Remember me affectionately, if you please, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
to dear Mr. Oliphant, and do not drive your
little car from the door without telling Lawrence
that I enquire for him. Farewell!</p>

<h2>LETTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Otway to Mrs. Douglas.</span></p>


<p>
Dearest Friend,
</p>

<p>My former letters have been faithful transcripts
from the book of our lives, and Frederick
has filled up all interstices, but before I proceed
to the main purpose which induces me to write
to-day, I must indulge myself, and not <i>displease
you</i>, by saying a few words of this dear
youth, whom I have hitherto only mentioned
incidentally, because I wished to see how he
would bear the whirl of a London scene, and
comport himself in some situations as trying
as they were novel to him, ere I trumpeted
his praise. You know how I abhor flattery,
and will therefore give me credit for believing
what I express of admiration for your son, who
really astonishes me. Though introduced for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
the first time to what is called, certainly not
<i>par excellence</i>, the Great World, he is neither
awkward nor confused. The easy polish of
<i>true</i> refinement which he learned at home, in the
bosom of that loved retreat where all the best
affections of his noble and manly heart are centered,
<i>frank</i> him into a metropolitan drawing-room,
as fearlessly as into your's at Glenalta;
and his manners exhibit the happiest combination
of boldness, in which there is no mixture
of presumption, and modesty without <i>mauvaise
honte</i>. With all the freshness of curiosity, and
the candour of one who disdains subterfuge, he
flies about collecting information&mdash;gratifying
his good taste, and honestly confessing his previous
ignorance of a thousand objects which
have ceased to stimulate, if they ever did so,
the vapid group by which we are environed.
The courage with which Frederick dares to express
his own thoughts, instead of borrowing
the hacknied reverberation of opinions often
adopted without discrimination, and rendered
current by an idle multitude, who, contented to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
follow a fashionable leader, never exert a faculty
for themselves, has something in it that <i>commands</i>
attention, and I continually hear the inquiry
of "who is he?" succeed the avowal of
some sentiment on his part at variance with the
modish creed.</p>

<p>If the novelty of Frederick's remarks occasionally
excite a smile, it is evidently always
accompanied with a desire to know more of
him. Even those who would not, for any consideration,
imitate his example, involuntarily
respect the <i>power</i> of his valorous intrepidity;
and that which in a vulgar man would be denominated
mere boorishness, assuming a very different
character when associated with native
elegance and good breeding, the automaton
throng are forced to admit the superiority which
they dare not copy, and venerate the independence
to which they cannot aspire. I assure you
also, that he is an object of great admiration
amongst the young ladies, one of whom having
heard, I suppose, that he was an Irishman,
sweetly lisped a few evenings ago, in half articulated <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
accents, "<i>le bel sauvage!</i>" Tell Fanny
that this anecdote is <i>genuine</i>, which she may be
at first inclined to doubt; and tell her likewise
that many a pretty head is half turned round to
see that Frederick lingers near the harp or
piano-forte, though he <i>does</i> come from that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">
<div class="line indent12">"Land of bogs,</div>
<div class="line">With ditches fenced&mdash;a Heaven fat with fogs."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>This</i> information will not surprise his sisters,
who have frequently experienced his dexterity
in turning over the leaves of a music book;
and for his dear mother's particular gratification
I must add, that I know not when I have
been more delighted with my young friend since
we left home together, than when any appeal to
his free will has elicited the declaration of his
entire dependence on the wishes of a parent.
There is something affectingly beautiful in the
generous openness, the amiable devotion, with
which this fine young man, just arrived at the
period of life so trying to the silly pride that
struggles against the semblance of authority,
refers to <i>your</i> wishes and opinion, upon every <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
occasion when he is called upon to enter into
projects for future amusement; and this not in
the low tone and creeping attitude of fear or
bashfulness, but with the erect air of honest
strength, that glories in the fond submission,
where love and duty bid it yield. His uncle's
discriminating eye has already marked these
things without a prompter's aid; and every little
instance which indicates <i>character</i>, is registered
with evident pleasure in favour of Frederick,
by the acute discernment of my poor
friend, on whom it is now time to say that I
have prevailed, in concert with Dr. Pancras, a
very worthy man, who accompanied him from
India, in quality of attending physician, to give
up all thoughts of going to Marsden for the
present. He is totally unfit to undertake a
house and establishment of his own, at this
time, and will require a long exemption from
care of every kind. His bodily frame is debilitated
to a great degree, and his mind calls for
every strengthener, too, that can be administered
to invigorate its tone. His character is deeply <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
interesting, and his situation mental, as well as
corporeal, extremely critical. The moral atmosphere
in which he is to be placed during
the next six months appears, if possible, more
important to his future happiness than the climate
in which he is to breathe is of consequence
to his health; and no part of the globe furnishes
such a union of all that he stands in need of as
Glenalta; I have therefore urged his passing
the winter in our valley. Till this morning I
could not obtain an answer, but at length he
promises to try an experiment, not, however,
<i>binding</i> himself to any definite period of sojournment
amongst us. When truth and delicacy
preside at the helm, there is no danger of steering
a wrong course. It is the manoeuvrer
only who requires a pilot; your guileless nature
needs no <i>hints</i> for regulating your conduct towards
this interesting invalid, and it is only to
make you in some measure acquainted with,
not to guide you in the <i>management</i> of his peculiarities,
that I dwell upon the description of
them. <i>You</i> knew nothing of your brother before <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
he went to India, and we have all lost
sight of him for many years; I cannot therefore
attempt to pursue, in any concatenated
series, the circumstances which have made him
what he is. I can only trace <i>effects</i>, and judge
from the data furnished by these to my observations
of what the <i>causes</i> may have been.
Since we have been together, a thousand trifling
occurrences have assisted me in developing a
character which must be unrolled with as much
nicety as is required to spread open the Pompeïan
manuscripts. The slightest accident
would prove fatal in either case, and one rude
touch would so effectually destroy the delicate
fabric of one and the other, as to render fruitless
any after attempt at deciphering the contents.
I was engaged in studying whatever had
arisen naturally to my view, when I one day,
as usual, went to visit him directly after breakfast;
he was not in the room when I entered,
and I found a volume of Shakspeare open on
the table, at which he had been reading. The
book was turned on its face, in the play of Macbeth, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
and a pencil lay upon the outside, which
had been probably employed the moment before
my entrance in marking with extra-ordinary
emphasis the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="verse">
<div class="line">"I have lived long enough: my way of life</div>
<div class="line">Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf:</div>
<div class="line">And that which should accompany old age,</div>
<div class="line">As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends</div>
<div class="line">I must not look to have; but, in their stead,</div>
<div class="line">Curses, not loud, but deep, mouth-honour, breath,</div>
<div class="line">Which the poor heart would fain deny, but dare not."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I instantly replaced the volume, and mused
when I left my poor friend on the singularity
of this little incident; for it is actually a fact
that, in rising to something like an abstract of
his character the night before, as I lay awake,
and contemplated the several traits which fell
under my remark, these very lines were cast up
by memory to pourtray the man.</p>

<p>Now, philosophers tell us, that when we arrive
at the same result by the opposite processes
of synthesis and analysis, we have good ground
to believe in the correctness of an argument.
If so, your brother's picture is delineated; for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
these affecting words addressed to Seyton by the
unhappy Thane, whether taken as a text from
which to deduce, or a conclusion at which you
arrive by a previous train of induction, equally
"<i>land</i>" the observer in that morbid melancholy
which has marked Douglas for her own.
His mind is of the finest material, bearing impress
of the race from which he springs. Had
he lived at home, and had his affections been
cultivated in those relations which supply successional
<i>crops</i> as it were to feed the heart, when
the first indigenous growth has died away, he
would have been a very <i>different</i> man, whether
<i>happier</i> or not we cannot tell. But loosened
by distance, and then dissevered by death from
those early bonds of instinct which "plays the
volunteer within us," he formed no new connections
to keep in exercise his best feelings,
which having lost the objects prepared for them
by nature, were scattered to the winds till they
became annihilated in diffusion. What a mistake
it is to fancy that a man acquires love for
his species in proportion to his becoming indifferent <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
towards individuals? Yet this is a common
error. No, true philanthropy shines on
the circumference from a glowing centre, and
the fond domestic affections are those which
send out most commonly the sweetest charities
to mankind.</p>

<p>Douglas is not a misanthrope, but he has
met with many disappointments, as all men
must do who form their early acquaintances&mdash;friendships
I will not call them&mdash;amongst the
multitude who are only bound together by the
casual ties of pleasure and convenience. The
temporary purpose gained, or the transient gratification
satisfied, no memory remains of favour
conferred, no gratitude survives for benefits
received. While youth continues we <i>waste</i> our
resources, because they are liberally replenished,
and in the abundance and variety of the springs
from whence they flow, we cannot anticipate
a season of dearth; but the cisterns, however
bounteously supplied, will become dry at last,
and even <i>drops</i> will, in the end, seem precious
of that which we lavished before with thoughtless <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
prodigality. Your brother, however, is too
just to hate his fellow-creatures because he has
neglected to render himself an object of their
love; but, though he does not actually set his
mind in array against them, he is too proud to
acknowledge dependence, and his temper is not
sufficiently under controul to prevent him from
involuntarily revenging on society the insulation
which he has imposed on himself, by avoiding
rather than courting communion with the world,
for an intercourse with the best and wisest of
which he is peculiarly gifted. It would seem as
if he had laid down a law for himself to be
severe and repellent, which the natural kindness
of his character renders impossible, and
the <i>most</i> that he can achieve is an air of uncertainty
bordering on caprice, which strangers
ascribe to bad health. I suspect that during
the halcyon days of youth, religion which, in
India, has been cruelly neglected, made no part
of his concern, but a mind of such height and
depth as his can never continue careless on the
subject of its immortal interests; and, if my observations <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
be correct, he is at this moment suffering
those <i>transition pangs</i> incident to the awakened
conviction of having been wrong, and
desiring to be right, which are rendered more
than commonly poignant in his instance by that
scrupulous conscientiousness which suggests the
inquiry whether his motive in searching after
truth may not partly arise from a belief that he
feels "the silver cords" beginning to give way
and threaten dissolution.</p>

<p>You will not think me tedious in thus endeavouring
to give you a clue to the character of
one who is formed in no ordinary mould, and
for whom I anticipate all the happiness which
he is capable of enjoying at Glenalta. You will
have no difficulty to contend with, no plot to
sustain. Oh! my dear Caroline, it is worth
coming into a sophisticated scene like this, to
behold, in all its loveliness, the beauty of a single
heart. The moral like the physical circumstances
which surround us daily, are not half
appreciated, because that they want contrast.
We are ungrateful and forget our blessings. I <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
shall have much to tell you, which I do not like
to write. Dear Arthur would furnish materials
for another sheet, but I must not lengthen this
letter, already so voluminous. Frederick's love,
with mine, to the <i>Trias Harmonica</i>, and Mr.
Oliphant. Adieu, dearest friend.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
